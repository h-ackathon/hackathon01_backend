Bangladesh wobbled when they lost both their set batsmen - Mominul Haque and Liton Das - quickly in the afternoon session. But their stand-in captain Mahmudullah and Mosaddek Hossain soaked up 106 balls to put the match beyond Sri Lanka's reach. The star of the day and the entire game was Mominul Haque, who become the first Bangladesh player to hit centuries in each innings of a Test. Liton was in sight of a century of his own before he lost his head and miscued a catch to mid-off running back. <b>All told, 1533 runs were scored for 24 wickets in five days</b>. That's a wrap. Thanks for your company and comments. Do come back for the second Test, which starts on February 8 in Dhaka. Until then, goodbye and cheers\n\nMominul (who else?) is the Player of the Match.\n\n\"I was looking for the hundred,\" Liton Das says. \"It was a mistake on my part. When me and Mominul batted we planned over by over. There are some rough patches, but we managed to cover it.\"\n\nMahneelMusa: \"Don't forget Mahmudullah's contribution in the first innings and then this gritty innings where he faced 11 overs in tough condition under immense pressure. Safe to say he has brilliantly led the team from the front!\"\n\nPraneeth: \"Just 24 wickets in 5 days. That's less than 5 wickets per day. Isn't this a \"Poor\" pitch?\"\n\nJoshua : \"I thought SL should have batted fast and declared earlier.Because that would have give bowlers a fair time to bowl out BD\"\n\nMasum Billag: \"Its a great comeback from Team Bangladesh.
