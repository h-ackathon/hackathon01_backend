We'll have plenty of post-match content coming your way. Don't forget to stick around for those. Have a good day!<br><bR>\n\n<b>Dinesh Chandimal:</b> This was a really good series. The first game was a nightmare for the bowlers and this one was a nightmare for the batters. The guys executed our gameplans really well out in the middle. After the first game we thought the second pitch might be a turning wicket. We were surprised, because we have all the experienced spinners. Credit also goes to Roshen Silva who had an outstanding series - even Kusal Mendis and Dhananjaya. Also all the bowlers. <Br><br>\n\n<b>Roshen Silva:</b> First of all I want to thank the almighty God for helping Chandimal win the toss on this wicket. We batted first and the rest is history. I thought this wicket was difficult so I just wanted to keep it simple - I just played my normal game. I think one of the strength's we have is the guys in the lower order never throw away their wickets. Even 20-30 runs is very valuable on this wicket. I hope and I pray that I can carry this forward for the rest of the career.<br><br>\n\n<b>Roshen Silva is the Man of the Match and the Man of the Series.</b><br><br>\n\n<b>Mahmudullah:</b> Feeling really disappointed because we knew the pitch would get us a result. In this sort of a wicket you should cash in on the first innings. Their bowlers did the job really well, keeping the pressure on us every time we came out. Our bowlers [only] did well in patches. One positive was the intent from Mominul. He played spinners on the front foot as well as the back. <br><br>\n\n<hr>\n\nSampath: \"Roshen Silva should play in limited over cricket as well. He is a well composed batsmen! \"<br><br>SudarshanaSL: \"Difference between the two sides batting was Roshen who held batting together in both innigs unlike Bangladesh.

Bangladesh barely had control through this game and the second innings ends much like the first  - with an exaggerated collapse at the end. It's been indicative of their resolve throughout the game. Sri Lanka gave them nothing, and for most parts, they didn't face resistance. Roshen Silva's fifties in both innings, Kusal's counterattacking 68 in the first, and Dananjaya's eight wickets on debut are the key performances that have done this for Sri Lanka.
