This will be a significant moment in their recovery. Been a very fine performance against a very good India team. The series is level at 1-1 and we should have a terrific second half to this series in Melbourne and Sydney.\n\nWould always have taken a miracle to deny Australia today and India's tail was blown away as expected. Nathan Lyon outstanding throughout the match, and Mitchell Starc cranked up the speed gun today. They'll be plenty of emotion in the Australian camp. Tim Paine and Justin Langer embrace. I'll stay with you for the presentations.\n\nYash: \"Great plan and execution from Australia. What should India do for next game? Drop both openers? Ash will come in, but who is he gonna replace Vihari/Umesh. Will bhuvi get his chance this tour? We have Pandya gunning for a place in the team as well. With all these options, one thing is sure; team management is going to mess it up again.\"\n\n<b>Mitchell Starc</b> \"It's been a lot of hard work. We said the tables would turn. Seeing some of the kids here this afternoon, hopefully we've put on a great show. This week shows the fight of this team and make people proud.\"\n\nTime for the presentation...\n\n<B>Virat Kohli</b> \"As a team I think we played well in patches which we can hold onto. Australia played much better than us with the bat. 330 on that pitch we felt was a bit too much. They deserved to win. We had the belief we could do it, but they were more relentless and put us in trouble. [Our bowlers] are outstanding as a pack, to see them dominate was really good to see and something we want to build on. They are relentless even if they aren't getting wickets which is a great quality. When we looked at the pitch we didn't think about [Jadeja] but I thought Nathan bowled really well. We never thought we wanted to consider a spinner, thought four fast bowlers would be enough. When you don't win you don't really rank your performances so it's irrelevant because we didn't get the result we wanted. I'm just focused on the next Test. [The catch to dismiss him] It was a decision made on the field and it stays there. Nothing more to it.\"\n\n<B>Tim Paine</b> \"It's probably more a relief at the moment, first Test win has taken a while. Really proud of the players and staff. Good to get a little bit of reward. It was as difficult Test, both have been tough Tests. Two really competitive sides with good fast bowling attack. The pitch was flying through. It seemed like the roller had a real effect on it. Day one was a bit of a funny one, we crossed our fingers. Marcus and Aaron, to get us none for 100 was brilliant and probably the difference in the end. Uzzie has been batting well for a long time, bowling really well to all of us. He's in a really good space. It's great to have Gaz, every team wants a spinner like Nathan Lyon. He loves bowling to the best players in the world.\"\n\nPlayer of the match goes to <b>Nathan Lyon</b> \"It's amazing to play a role in a victory, haven't had one in a while. Thanks to everyone. Can't wait to sing the song. It's fair to say we've been in a drought, so good to break. Was special to wrap the tail up quickly. My role probably changed a bit, attacking in Adelaide to a defending on here. But luckily they ran down to the wicket to create a few footholes. When you come up against the best players, to compete against Virat and take his wicket was pretty special. Big thanks to my brother, I'm not a very good batter so just trying to play my role.\"\n\nSo that just about wraps things up for this Test. It's a very enjoyable watch (when you aren't a batsman!). We'll be back for Boxing Day, but before then there's the <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/25554165/how-teams-stack-to-watch-for\">start of the BBL</a> tomorrow and we'll have full coverage of that. For now, from Gnasher and Alex, it's goodbye and thanks for joining us.","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":55.5,"text":"Cummins to Bumrah, no run, short again, another swing and a miss","event":0,"commId":"455060","commSeq":405506,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":55.4,"text":"Cummins to Bumrah, no run, backing to leg, goes for a swing over the leg side, doesn't make contact","event":0,"commId":"455050","commSeq":405505,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":55.3,"text":"Cummins to Sharma, <b>OUT</b>, <b>caught behind!</b> It's one to go.
