See you soon.\n\nA win that will be remembered for a long time. The thing that stood out, as Rashid said, was how the Afghanistan batsmen applied themselves. Rahmat and Asghar were expected to play the roles they did - the former becoming Afghanistan's first Test centurion - but what more heartening to see was the way Ibrahim Zadran and Afsar Zazai batted. Both showed great technique and scored crucial runs. Then Rashid's fifty in the first innings and 11 wickets in the game on captaincy debut took them over the line.\n\nW Khpalwak : \"Afghan Cricket faced some problems in World Cup where we Afghans were embarrassed. After that I wasn't interested in the cricket anymore. Today after a long time I got happy for cricket and want to heartily congratulate ACB for the great achievement. Well done BOYS.\"\n\nVijay Thummar: \"I was on Cricinfo for full day just to read commentary for last wicket !!!\"\n\n<b>Rashid Khan:</b> The credit goes to the players, supporting staff. The camp we had in Abu Dhabi was in the hottest weather I have ever been and then you come here; compared to that, it looked easier out here. It was a total team effort. The youngsters are learning very quickly, and especially we have a good four-day structure at home. That's the best thing done by the cricket board. The challenge was for the batsmen to stay at the pitch for as long as possible and they did a terrific job. One more thing. The legend Nabi, who has played his last Test, has helped me and other young spinners a lot. I wish him all the best and I want to dedicate my Man-of-the-Match award to him.\n\n<b>Rashid Khan is Player of the Match.</b>\n\n<b>Shakib Al Hasan:</b> I think it's combination of application of our batsmen and Afghanistan bowling. We need to do a lot of hard work to become a good, consistent team. After playing for 20 years, we cannot say it's a build-up process. We are playing a Test after quite some time but credit goes to Afghanistan. We need to forget this match as soon as possible and focus on the T20 series. Afghanistan are a very good team in that format. With the [T20] World Cup coming up next year, we need to focus on T20s.\n\nTime for presentation.\n\nRajiv Mel: \"I'm a Lankan with nothing to do with these two nations but I found myself pumping my fist after that last wicket. Great stuff\"\n\n<b>5.20pm</b> What a win for Afghanistan. What a farewell Test for Mohammad Nabi who is getting a guard of honour. Oh, looked like Rashid and Asghar hadn't joined, so he is getting a second guard of honour. But what a performance by Afghanistan. First Rahmat Shah and Asghar Afghan led the way in the first innings. Then Rashid's five-wicket haul helped them bowl Bangladesh for just 205. After setting a target of 398, Rashid once again showed the way as Afghanistan fought the lower-order resistance and rain to script a win with only 3.2 overs left in the Test.<br><br>","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":61.3,"text":"Rashid Khan to Soumya Sarkar, no run, slower on the stumps, blocked again","event":0,"commId":"461030","commSeq":406103,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":61.2,"text":"Rashid Khan to Soumya Sarkar, no run, length ball around off once more, Soumya goes back, looks to defend with soft hands, from the face of the bat to on to the pads and rolls on the off side","event":0,"commId":"461020","commSeq":406102,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":61.1,"text":"Rashid Khan to Soumya Sarkar, no run, length ball around off, goes back and defends it on the leg side","event":0,"commId":"461010","commSeq":406101,"dismissalText":"","pre":"Four overs left","post":"","hasVideoId":false}],"overNo":62,"completed":false},{"comments":[{"timeStamp":60.6,"text":"Zahir Khan to Nayeem Hasan, no run, fuller around off, lunges forward and dead-bats it","event":0,"commId":"460060","commSeq":406006,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":60.5,"text":"Zahir Khan to Nayeem Hasan, no run, spinning back in from outside off, Nayeem goes deep and blocks","event":0,"commId":"460050","commSeq":406005,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false}],"overNo":61,"completed":true,"endOfOver":"61 | 2 Runs | BDESH: 173/9","endOfOverRunsReq":"","batsmen":[{"name":"Nayeem Hasan","stat":"1 (8b)"},{"name":"Soumya Sarkar","stat":"15 (55b)"}],"bowlers":[{"name":"Zahir Khan","stat":"15-0-59-3"},{"name":"Rashid Khan","stat":"21-6-49-5"}],"hasLastEndOfOver":true}],"href":"/series/19449/commentary/1197138/bangladesh-vs-afghanistan-only-test-afg-in-bangladesh-2019","enabled":true,"scorer":"Chandan Duorah","commentator":"Hemant Brar","commentPreText":"Four overs left","trackingName":"&lpos=cricket:game:scorecard:fullcommentary","groundTime":"","currentOver":61},"scorecard":{"innings":{"1":{"title":"Afghanistan 1st Innings","inningStatus":"","isCurrent":false,"batsmen":[{"name":"Ibrahim Zadran","displayName":"Ibrahim Zadran","href":"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/921509.html","captain":false,"roles":"","trackingName":"&lpos=cricket:game:scorecard:player","hasVideoId":false,"stats":[{"name":"runs","text":"R","value":"21"},{"name":"ballsFaced","text":"B","value":"69"},{"name":"minutes","text":"M","value":"84"},{"name":"fours","text":"4s","value":"3"},{"name":"sixes","text":"6s","value":"0"},{"name":"strikeRate","text":"SR","value":"30.43"}],"isNotOut":false,"commentary":"<b>a mis-hit from Ibrahim</b>, was tossed up on the stumps, Ibrahim comes down the track and looks to go over the bowler's head.
