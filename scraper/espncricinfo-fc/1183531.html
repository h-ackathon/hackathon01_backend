More valuable WTC points in the bag. A victory set-up by the batsmen (especially Warner) and completed efficiently by the bowlers despite some blips in the field and a bit of toil from time to time. Pakistan offered some moments of fight in both Tests, but their bowling was just too far short of what was needed on these pitches. They'll head home (properly home) to focus on Sri Lanka in a couple of weeks. For Australia, attention now turns to the visit of New Zealand for three Tests. We'll bring you the presentation shortly.\n\nAby Mathew: \"Head neither bowled, batted or took a catch. Must have been the easiest test match of his life so far.\" Man of the Match contender?\n\nRickyg: \"Any thoughts on how the Aussies sit ahead of NZ arriving - these 2 results suggest they are on fire, performances in England and world rankings suggest Kiwis have a good shot??\" Australia favourites, but should be a great contest.\n\nMan of the Match and Series is <B>David Warner</b>. \"I'm very happy we didn't have to bat again. I was very tired last night, fell asleep on the couch. Great team performance, to win two in a row by an innings. For us, [this Test] it's a memory and reflect of our mates' life - it was on his [Hughes'] birthday as well - difficult time for the guys. Adelaide is a nice batting track, back yourself. Enjoying it even more and hungrier than ever. We'll be coming up against quality opposition in New Zealand, we know every time they come across it's a good contest.\"\n\n<b>Azhar Ali</b> \"I'd like to congratulate Australia, they played wonderful cricket, especially David Warner for his triple hundred. It's always hard coming to Australia, we've been beaten by a better side. We lacked in all three departments in both Tests but we take some positives and learnings. If you don't bowl good and line they always score quickly and you have to field well. When you get in, score big and make big partnerships. We said we didn't want to give up at any stage. Yasir put up a lot of fight. Babar has been exceptional in this series, that's a great positive. It's very hard here with a young bowling attack, we came with a lot of expectations but it didn't go well. Very positive for the future, we will learn a lot.\"\n\n<b>Tim Paine</b> \"Really happy, probably barring a few slips in the field. Played some fantastic cricket. Really pleasing to get the results to start the summer. What we wanted from our batters was big runs. Our batters, David and Marnus, have been unbelievably good. Guys are stepping up, that's what good sides do. [Warner] We witnessed something really special. Unbelievable innings, top one or two from an Australian of all time. [Warner getting 400?] We didn't debate it, spoke about it that we had a time to declare. Davey was all for it, we are here to win Test matches and climb rankings. Wanted to make sure we had time to win the game. Never came into the calculations. [Starc] Think he's okay, just a big toe thing which he has to warm up. Thought our bowlers were huge, difficult wicket for bowlers unless the lights are on. Awesome effort, they kept coming. Best spinner in the world stood up today, though Lyno was awesome. I'd like to hold a few more catches, the challenge of the pink ball Test can be fielding. It is very different. We need to get better at that with Perth in a week's time. The next three Tests will be really competitive.\"\n\nSo that just about wraps things up for this series. Very convincing by Australia, plenty of questions for Pakistan. We'll be back at the weekend for coverage of the WBBL finals and then attention turns to the first Test against New Zealand in Perth. For now, though, from Gnasher, Alex and the rest of the crew it's goodbye and thanks for joining us.","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":81.5,"text":"Hazlewood to Muhammad Musa, no run, woosh!
