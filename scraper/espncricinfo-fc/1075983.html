That was too good. This has been a terrific spell of reverse swing bowling. A full delivery outside off, Elgar prods, the ball moves away like an offbreak, takes the outside edge and goes through to Paine. A very gritty 57, but Australia are right back in this one. <span class="text-bold"> 155/4 </span></div></div></div><div class="flex-row" data-reactid="458"><div class="wrap batsmen" data-reactid="459"><div class="cell batsmen" data-reactid="460"><a name="&amp;lpos=cricket:game:scorecard:player" href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/600498.html" title="View the player profile of Aiden Markram" data-reactid="461">AK Markram</a></div><div class="cell commentary" data-reactid="462"><a class="icon-font-before collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#commentary-002-1" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="commentary-002">lbw b Cummins</a></div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="463">11</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="464">21</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="465">33</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="466">1</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="467">0</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="468">52.38</div><div class="cell highlight active" data-reactid="469"></div></div><div id="commentary-002-1" class="commentary-content collapse" data-reactid="470"><div class="content" data-reactid="471"><span class="text-bold"> 7.4 </span> <b>plumb!</b> Markram's got one angled into him, and he's late on it.

What a soft end to an otherwise solid innings. Floated full and outside off, Bancroft simply reaches out for the ball with his hands and brings his bat down at an awkward angle. An inside edge trickles back onto the base of off stump and the off bail gets dislodged.

Rabada hits that in-between length - neither driveable nor pullable - and gets the ball to move back in against the angle from outside off. He slices through the defences of the opener and tilts the off stump back. No shoulder brushes, no contact. More sedate celebrations from Rabada, if one could call that.

Too good from Hazlewood. Australia not giving up. It's another stunning delivery, on a good length, the ball moving away. Markram is lulled into playing because of the threat of reverse swing and the threat of bowled or lbw. It doesn't come in, it goes away. Takes the outside edge, flies in between first and second slip. But Smith steps up, moves well to his left and takes a smart catch. Excellent stuff <span class="text-bold"> 32/2 </span></div></div></div><div class="flex-row" data-reactid="970"><div class="wrap batsmen" data-reactid="971"><div class="cell batsmen" data-reactid="972"><a name="&amp;lpos=cricket:game:scorecard:player" href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/230852.html" title="View the player profile of Dean Elgar" data-reactid="973">D Elgar</a></div><div class="cell commentary" data-reactid="974"><a class="icon-font-before collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#commentary-002-3" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="commentary-002">c &amp; b Lyon</a></div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="975">5</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="976">17</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="977">24</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="978">0</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="979">0</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="980">29.41</div><div class="cell highlight active" data-reactid="981"></div></div><div id="commentary-002-3" class="commentary-content collapse" data-reactid="982"><div class="content" data-reactid="983"><span class="text-bold"> 5.1 </span> <b>superb catch</b> off his own bowling.

That's an excellent piece of bowling from Lyon. He sees AB coming and shortens the length just a touch, which means the ball isn't full.

I have a feeling it would have gone their way had SA won the toss and possibly chose to bat first.\"","post":"<b>1.53pm</b> Another terrific game of Test match cricket. South Africa win by six wickets to level the series in Port Elizabeth, setting up their series very very well. There has been a lot of off-field noise, so loud that is threatened to spoil the activities on the field. But the cricket has let no one down. Australia were just maybe 100 runs short, just like SA were in Durban. \n\nTwo standout performances from South Africa this Test: AB de Villiers with the bat, one of his best Test innings ever to lead South Africa to a match-winning lead, and Kagiso Rabada, who took 11 wickets in the Test to lead the bowling effort. Australia just did not have enough to deal with the pyrotechnics of those two.\n\nA good bowling performance from Australia in the fourth innings, taking four wickets, but again, just not enough runs to force the batsmen into mistakes.\n\nMeanwhile, live updates of the World Cup Qualifier <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/22729641/\" target=\"_blank\">right here</a>. \n\nTime for the presentation.\n\n<b>Kagiso Rabada is the Man of the Match</b>: \"I'm glad, put in the preparation and things happened for me this Test. Always nice bowling with the hard, new rock. Always enjoyable. Something that needs to be on point against good batters (lengths). I don't think so (a batting promotion), I'll stick to nightwatchman. The one to Warner was special. Australia are not going to roll over easily.\"\n\n<b>Faf du Plessis</b>: \"Serious character, we absorbed pressure well. Amla and Elgar in the first innings, if you have AB, he can transfer pressure back. Great turnaround from the previous Test, where it was the opposite. The first hour was pretty well, we then went to the beach for a little bit. Absolute champion of a bowler, Rabada. AB looked like he batted on a different pitch. Two bowlers get excessive reverse swing, Starc and KG. If we can keep Australia quiet, that's half the battle. It's disappointing for the series (Rabada's impending hearing), you want your best players to play the series. We'll challenge that to keep him in the series.\"\n\n<b>Steven Smith</b>: \"They outplayed us in every aspect of the game. AB was a big difference between the sides, we weren't too far away. 75 runs in the first innings, 50 in the second, and it could have gone either way. Rabada bowled exceptionally well. Yesterday morning was a tough one, we hoped we could get them quickly, keep their lead to 50. 140 was a lot. We came out really well, got AB out conventionally out for the first time this series, gives us confidence.\"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":22.4,"text":"Cummins to de Bruyn, no run, short, outside off, de Bruyn this time gets underneath","event":0,"commId":"422040","commSeq":402204,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":22.3,"text":"Cummins to du Plessis, 1 run, 139 kph, on the pads, clipped away to deep square leg for one","event":1,"commId":"422030","commSeq":402203,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":22.2,"text":"Cummins to du Plessis, no run, full outside off, pushed towards mid-off","event":0,"commId":"422020","commSeq":402202,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":22.1,"text":"Cummins to du Plessis, no run, digs this in, Faf gets underneath","event":0,"commId":"422010","commSeq":402201,"dismissalText":"","pre":"<strong>4 more required</strong>, the brass band is in full flow.","post":"","hasVideoId":false}],"overNo":23,"completed":false},{"comments":[{"timeStamp":21.6,"text":"Lyon to de Bruyn, <b>FOUR</b> runs, four of them.
