He has been given out leg before by umpire Erasmus. Rahul tucks his bat in and walks off. Pujara then chats with him, and Rahul eventually calls for a review. Is this heading down leg? Length ball, big inswinger from Woakes, catches Rahul in the crease, he plays around it and is rapped on the back pad. Ball-tracking suggests it would crash into leg stump. Woakes takes out both the Indian openers after a solid start. After testing Rahul with five balls that moved away or held its line outside off, Woakes brings this one back in and nabs Rahul.

Five catches for KL, all at second slip. <span class="text-bold"> 62/3 </span></div></div></div><div class="flex-row" data-reactid="998"><div class="wrap batsmen" data-reactid="999"><div class="cell batsmen" data-reactid="1000"><a name="&amp;lpos=cricket:game:scorecard:player" href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/887207.html" title="View the player profile of Ollie Pope" data-reactid="1001">OJ Pope</a></div><div class="cell commentary" data-reactid="1002"><a class="icon-font-before collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#commentary-004-3" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="commentary-004">c Kohli b Mohammed Shami</a></div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="1003">16</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="1004">39</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="1005">63</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="1006">3</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="1007">0</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="1008">41.02</div><div class="cell highlight active" data-reactid="1009"></div></div><div id="commentary-004-3" class="commentary-content collapse" data-reactid="1010"><div class="content" data-reactid="1011"><span class="text-bold"> 25.1 </span> <b>another sensational grab</b> This time it's Kohli leaping to his left from third slip, hands in the reverse-cup position, stretching high above his head seeking the ball, and it sticks!

This has been some series, and it's 2-1 going into the fourth Test in Southampton. England have the lead, but they also have more to ponder - about their combination, and the form of their top order in particular. There are injuries for both teams to worry about, to two big performers, R Ashwin and Jonny Bairstow. India, remember, only named a squad for the first three Tests, so there's a big announcement in the wings from the selectors as well. Will Bhuvneshwar Kumar manage to regain fitness for the fourth or even the fifth Test? There's Alastair Cook and the chance that he might miss the fourth Test on paternity leave. There's a lot of uncertainty, but one thing is very, very clear. This series is crackling with excitement now, and we can't wait for Thursday, August 30. Until then, we'll leave you with the wicket that wrapped up India's win here at Trent Bridge. Goodbye!\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/video/clip?id=24442605\" target=\"_blank\"><b>WATCH - Ashwin takes the last England wicket with a legbreak (India only) </b></a>\n\n<b>Virat Kohli is the Player of the Match</b>. (Yay, only one more interview to transcribe). \"First and foremost, we as a team want to dedicate the victory to the flood victims back home in Kerala. People are going through a lot, and this is the least we can do,\" he says. \"Very pleasing performance in all three departments. A complete Test match for us. We only spoke about the fact that we were only outplayed in one Test out of the five we had played since South Africa, and that was at Lord's. We spoke about stepping up as batsmen, and that's what we did, and we set it up for the bowlers. The bowling group was eager to take those 20 wickets again - the question was what we could do as batsmen to give them that cushion. When both skills come together with slip catching, we win Test matches. Everything came together for us. Very crucial how Rahane played, having lost Puji just before lunch. He's very positive, we love that about him. He can change the whole complexion of the game, and that's what he did. They're a quality bowling attack and you need grit to score against them, and that's what Jinx in the first innings and Puji in the second showed. I want to dedicate my innings especially to my wife. She's motivated me a lot, kept pushing me. She's the only one who keeps me positive out there. The most pleasing thing for me to see was that the four fastest bowlers in the series have all been Indians. We've worked on our fitness, on our mindset, cutting down on loose deliveries. They're getting better and better the more Test cricket they've played. It's a delight to watch when they're running in. We definitely believe we can [win the series]. It wouldn't be 2-1 now if we didn't believe that. We just want to keep pushing forward and keep wanting to win.\"\n\n<b>Joe Root</b>: \"It's a strong team. It was always going to be a difficult decision (at the toss). There was some live grass on the wicket. We were performing extremely well with the ball, and potentially could have bowled them out quickly. We could have bowled a bit fuller, but that's nitpicking. India batted extremely well on that first day. I think it's fair to say we underperformed in our first innings. The second-innings partnership between Jos and Ben was a lesson to us, the way they adapted to the situation, how clear they looked about how they were going to score their runs. We need to look at that and see how we can adapt our own games to score 400 in the first innings. We've generally bowled well at him [Kohli], he's not scored too quickly against us, but he's found ways to score runs. We're working extremely hard on our catching, we know it's a massively important area. It's not worked out until now, but if we get it right we know it will play massive dividends. [On Bairstow:] It's early days, we have to see how that swelling comes down. We'll see over the next few days where he's at. He's in fine form, and it will be great if he plays. It's been challenging conditions for the top order, for both sides. We've got to be realistic about things - we've got two very good players at the top of the order. We've got to go back and find ways to adapt, and that's not just those two guys. The best thing about [Buttler's innings] is that he can crash the ball to all parts, but the thing about him is how he can look at a situation and work out how to play. To have that performance in the bank will give him a great deal of confidence.\"\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/video/clip?id=24442551\" target=\"_blank\"><b> WATCH - What did Kohli say to Broad when Broad was at the crease? </b></a>\n\nSai: \"Also at Perth 2008 another allrounder, the inimitable Irfan Pathan scored a 50 and took 5 wickets\" -- He scored 46, but yes. Took out both openers in both innings.\n\nPurvesh: \"Good performance around Kohli from the likes of Hardik, Bumrah, Ajinkya & Pujara was the difference between this Test & the first Test. A couple of half-decent performances in that game & India could have been 2-1 up.\"\n\nDhaval : \"For the next Test, England must bring back Sam Curran and Moeen Ali. And India should just bring back the same intensity with which they played this Test match.\"\n\nHemal: \"Similar to famous Perth win after ill-fated Sydney Test. India bounced back really well and hope they will keep this momentum for next two Tests.\" -- Yup, lots of similarities, starting from the partnership between Kohli and Rahane on day one, which was so much like the partnership between Tendulkar and Dravid back in that Perth Test in 2008.\n\nVivek Bhandari: \"I haven't seen the previous wins on English soil but my favorite has to be Headingley 2002 for the reasons how they were cornered after the first Test loss. They opted to bat first in overcast conditions as they had 2 spinners in their line up. Started slow and steady and changed gears in the latter part of the innings. And then the bowlers finished up the job.\"\n\nBrutus_Shylock: \"\" How much more authoritative can you get than a 203-run margin?\" Well obviously, any score above that margin.\"\n\nVarahan: \"A huge well deserved victory for India. The margin of victory is significant, no doubt. Although a more authoritative win would have inflicted serious psychological damage to England.\" -- How much more authoritative can you get than a 203-run margin?\n\nSunny: \"Joe root played a prominent role in India's win by deciding to bowl first after winning the toss and not playing the previous man of the match Curran. Love you joe root, please continue the same for the next two Test matches.\"\n\n<b>11.10am</b> Ten minutes is all it took, and 17 balls. A richly deserved win for India, their seventh in England and one of their finest away from home. Think back to what their morale must have been like coming into Nottingham, after a mauling at Lord's. They were given an unexpected gift by Joe Root, who chose to bowl first on a pitch that, though grassy, looked dry on the first morning. India still needed to bat and bowl extremely well, though, and they did just that, session after session, to really show everyone why they're ranked No. 1 in the world.","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":104.4,"text":"Ashwin to Rashid, 1 run, this one's flighted just outside off and Rashid sweeps again, with the turn, to long leg","event":1,"commId":"4104040","commSeq":410404,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":104.3,"text":"Ashwin to Rashid, no run, floats this one out of the front of the hand, ends up down the leg side, past Rashid's attempted sweep","event":0,"commId":"4104030","commSeq":410403,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":104.2,"text":"Ashwin to Rashid, no run, flat length ball outside off, defended off the front foot","event":0,"commId":"4104020","commSeq":410402,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":104.1,"text":"Ashwin to Anderson, 3 runs, tossed up fairly wide of off stump, stretches out and squeezes it away behind point.
