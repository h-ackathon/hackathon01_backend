Ambris having run all the way to the striker's end has to now run all the way back. But he doesn't, leaving Hetmyer stranded. What does Jadeja do? Instead of throwing the ball to Ashwin, he runs in and as it to taunt the batsman, gives the impression he'll eventually break the stumps, but wait, with him around three of four yards away from the stumps just throws the ball at the stumps. It hit this time, so it's all good, but I'm just imagining the comical scenes if he would've missed. I think that's exactly what Kohli's telling him too.

A dipping, drifting, flighted ball outside off stump lulls Chase into a loose shot. Looks to drive on the up, against the turn with a massive gap between bat and pad. This is a proper set up, because Chase has barely been made to stretch outside off against spin. Gets an inside edge and it's into the stumps <span class="text-bold"> 159/8 </span></div></div></div><div class="flex-row" data-reactid="546"><div class="wrap batsmen" data-reactid="547"><div class="cell batsmen" data-reactid="548"><a name="&amp;lpos=cricket:game:scorecard:player" href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/431905.html" title="View the player profile of Shane Dowrich" data-reactid="549">SO Dowrich &dagger;</a></div><div class="cell commentary" data-reactid="550"><a class="icon-font-before collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#commentary-007-1" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="commentary-007"> b Kuldeep Yadav</a></div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="551">10</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="552">35</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="553">26</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="554">1</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="555">0</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="556">28.57</div><div class="cell highlight active" data-reactid="557"></div></div><div id="commentary-007-1" class="commentary-content collapse" data-reactid="558"><div class="content" data-reactid="559"><span class="text-bold"> 25.2 </span> he's thoroughly been outfoxed here.

That's a terrible, terrible shot to play. What was the need? I don't know. Did they need 20 runs in two overs? No. The situation demanded he bat, bat and bat. Instead, he looks for an ugly slog and slices it to short third man. The turn does him in as he looks to slog across the line, the dip ensures the ball takes the edge. Catches like those won't be dropped most times. This is terrible batting from West Indies and as a coach, Stuart Law, even if he is going to resign after this series, has every right to ask for accountability. Very, very poor.

Look out for the post-match menu on our home page and don't forget to join us again for the second Test.<br><br>\n\n<b>Shaw:</b> Feels good. It was a great win. Scoring myself and getting the team to a win on my debut. couldn't have imagined it so I feel good. Whenever you play international cricket, there is always a challenge. I was looking to play my natural game, the way I play in FC cricket, and play the ball on the merit. <br><bR>\n\n<b>Prithvi Shaw is the Man of the Match.</b><br><br>\n\n<b>Kohli:</b> I don't think you can compare the two conditions [England and India]. That was a bigger challenge. We understand that with the ability we have, we will dominate in these conditions. We were very clinical. It's not something for to speak on [West Indies' performance] I'm sure they'll sort out the errors. We don't want to focus on what the opposition does. I'm happy we were clinical. Delighted for Prtivhi and Jaddu. Playing his first game, seeing him dominate - the guy showed he is different quality. That's why he's been pushed to the Test team. It is exciting to see from the captain's perspective. Jaddu as well - he has got important runs for us before and we wanted him to get three figures. We believe he can turn matches for us. \n\nIf you see the first innings, the way Umesh and Shami ran into bowl. Few wickets with the new ball and you can put the opposition under pressure. Shami took wickets on a pitch that was offerig nothing. Didn't want to play four bowlers with the heat factor.\n\n[The good over rate] It was a bit to do with the umpires pushing us as well. With the new rule of not drinking water. The guys struggled a bit because of that, it was difficult for guys to bat 45 minutes without water. I'm sure they'll look at those rules and adjust it for conditions. <br><br>\n\n\n<b>Kraigg Brathwaite:</b> Not the best of starts but obviously credits to India. They played well and showed us how to bat, especially. As a batting unit we didn't get any partnerships put together and that cost us. I think the batters we have are fully capable of doing the job. We need two or three big partnerships to set it up. What we said in our meeting is to stick to plans, positive in defence and positive in attack. We didn't get the results. Not sure if Holder is fit for the next match.<br><br>\n\nsangit: \"Shaw for MoM for setting it up nicely at the top? Or Jadeja for an all round performance?\"<br><br>Vinayak: \"Balance restored! Both the biggest test wins of these countries have come against each other \"<br><br>Manu: \"I hope someone sits down with the WI team and talks to them. Their problems seem to be stemming from a lack of mental will rather than ability\"<br><br>\n\n<b>Ashwin:</b> Just wanted to take off from where I'd left in England where I was bowling well. I wanted to get the drift back. Adductor strain makes you feel soft when you return but I've done work at NCA and I've been running as well. Much better now but long way to go. [About Kuldeep's adjustment] Fair amount of difference switching between white and red ball - the Kookabuura seam has gone thin these days, doesn't swing or seam. He didn't have a lot of time.\n\n[About cricket balls these days] Right now I say Kookaburra red ball is the best, and Duke's is quite good. Disappointed with the SG ball. It used to be top notch when I started playing. The seam would be prominent even after 70 overs. It's not the same any more.\n\n[On West Indies batting] I genuinely believed there would be more fight and partnerships from West Indies in the second innings. Was a little surprised. They came out to attack the spinners and it didn't work.<br><br>\n\n\n<b>Kuldeep:</b> Yeah it's very difficult to bowl with the red ball, coming from white ball cricket. It takes time to adjust. I adjusted in the second innings according to the wicket and the batsman. When you start doing well in red-ball, everything works well.  I spoke to the coach and he said try to bowl from around the wicket. I was happy with round the wicket. I'm more used to the white ball, so it takes a bit of time.<br>\n\n<b>2:52pm</b> We're left with more than half a session in the day as West Indies are bowled out for a second time. There's no need to say who dominated this game and how. Kuldeep ends with a five-for, Jadeja adds to his MOTM case by adding three wickets to his trunk in what has been a superb Test for him at home. Kieran Powell and his fellow batsmen came out trying to attack, but only Powell could succeed. A crisp innings from him, but the partnerships just couldn't happen apart from his second-wicket stand with Hope.","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":50.4,"text":"Jadeja to Gabriel, no run, length on off stump, blocked on the front foot","event":0,"commId":"350040","commSeq":305004,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":50.3,"text":"Jadeja to Gabriel, <b>FOUR</b> runs, length ball pushed through fast outside off.
