Australia dominant again. But some positives for Pakistan in the second innings. The second Test starts on Friday in Adelaide. It is a day-night pink ball Test. Do join us then. Goodbye for now.\n\n<strong>5.08pm Presentation</strong> <strong>Azhar Ali</strong>: \"When we won the toss, we wanted to score big in the first innings. But I think on the first day we won two sessions but we lost one very badly. I think if you lose one session very badly in Test matches it is always very hard to come back from that especially in Australia. I think that was the missed opportunity. Then when we came out to bowl we didn't build enough pressure. Babar and Rizwan showed the way today and also Shan played really well. It's always tough leaving Abbas out. He's always performed well for us. But these three who played had been bowling exceptionally well. They bowled phenomenally against a very good Australia A side. I think Abbas is always there for us. We'll look at the balance in the next couple of days. Naseem was bowling well. He looked very fit. We don't want him to break obviously. He is very young. We want him to have a long career. Yes we want him badly but we had to manage him accordingly.\"\n\n<strong>Tim Paine</strong>: Really happy. Any time you win a Test by over an innings you've done a lot right. Really proud of the way we started. There's no secret throughout the winter we relied on Steve Smith a little bit too much. We've got some real quality in our batting order. We've got some games into some guys now like Marnus and Travis Head. So we've got a reasonable batting line up and to score 580 is what you want. Fantastic to see Davey back. We knew when he got back to Australia he's a different proposition and he played superbly. Joe and David have a really good connection and I thought they set the tone. I think everyone was really proud of Marnus. He works as hard as anyone. We were really pleased for Marnus to finally arrive on the big stage. I thought the bowlers were pretty good. We hold them to a really high standard. They've taken 20 wickets for us so we're lucky to have them.\"\n\n<strong>Marnus Labuschagne is player of the match.</strong> Marnus Labuschagne: \"It's pretty special to have it pan out like this. It's good to have a winning contribution and help us win the Test match. It's a big thing for not only me but also my family. Some of the technical changes that I have done since England have helped me so much.\"\n\n<strong>Australia win by an innings and 5 runs inside four days.</strong> They were simply too good. Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan tested Australia today. Babar made an outstanding century, his second in Tests. Rizwan came with five runs of his first before holing out. Australia's quicks were outstanding on a flat pitch. Hazlewood finished with four wickets, Starc picked up three including two key breakthroughs last night.\n\nAustralia go 1-0 up.\n\nPat Cummins: \"Our batters set it up. Gave the bowlers two days off and it was easier on fresher legs. Babar and Rizwan batted beautifully. it was a pretty nice wicket. Not much sideways movement. They batted beautifully and took advantage of that.\"\n\nPranav Raj: \"Gabbatoir remains unbreached\"","hasVideoId":false,"video":{},"videoId":28151382},{"timeStamp":84.1,"text":"Starc to Imran Khan, <b>FOUR</b> runs, 148kph, full and straight, he backs away and <strong>smashes a line drive over the bowlers head!
