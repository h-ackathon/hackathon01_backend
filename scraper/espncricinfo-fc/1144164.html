See you soon.\n\nLakshitha: \"Stopped watching when Sri Lanka were 110 for 5, thinking that it would be another heart break. As it turns out, I am heart broken since I could watch the epic finish...!

I need to, and so does everyone involved in the match. Surely, one of he greatest matches in the history of the game?\"\n\nDeepak Samson: \"I am a huge fan of Faf but he lost the plot today.....taking the second new ball and allowing Kusal to farm the strike effortlessly was luke warm captaincy....also kudos to Kusal for not with drawing into a shell and keep scoring briskly...that was what won it in the end...\"\n\nAbhijato: \"I'm going to remember this for the rest of my life, and so will everyone else who saw it. I Kusal-ute you, Mendis!\"\n\nAhaan: \"@Patrick: Not quite. For SA you wrote for how many runs they lost 5 wickets, i.e. 6th wicket partnership not included. But for SL you wrote how much the last 5 partnerships scored.\"\n\nPatrick: \"Last 5 wickets in the 2nd innings, SA - 8 & SL - 194. Thisara Perera almost did it vs NZ ODI, but Kusal Perera just won it......... respect!!!!! \"\n\nPS: \"Faf has been poor today. Not being able to stop the single is the least of it. For major portions of the day, it seemed like he had taken that a win was guaranteed. His decision making was casual, keeping Rabada on too long after lunch, and ditto Maharaj before the new ball. And the taking the hard new ball with a set batsman and target in 30's was the worst decision. \"\n\nBinura Kandanea: \"Vishwa Fernando apart from surviving 27 balls also took the most number of wickers in the match. Great game for him too.\"\n\nStu: \"Never playing poker against Dimuth, the most underwhelming assessment of Perera's innings could bluff me any day... \"\n\nLakwin: \"What a brilliant test Innings by Kusal Janith! Marshaled the tail to orchestrate one of our great test wins. Credit to Embuldeniya and Vishwa as well, they made this possible with their tireless bowling. KJPs innings surely will go down as one of the best innings by a SLankan in a chase, along with Mahelas 152* vs SA in 2006\"\n\n<b>Kusal Perera is the Man-of-the-Match.</b> \"I am bit tired now,\" Kusal says [he looks exhausted]. \"I don't know what to say. The lower order supported well. I believed myself in that time, and we did it. Still I am thinking I did my part. This is really special win for us. We did a lot of homework, a lot of hard work.\"\n\n<b>Dimuth Karunaratne:</b> That was a really good game. We had a tough series in Australia but we learnt well. We have lost a lot of matches in last few years, so it's a proud moment for us, the team, and for me as captain. (On dressing room scenes) We were staying in our places, we were not moving. I think he [Kusal Perera] batted really well, getting a hundred in South Africa is not easy, against this fast bowling attack. The two debutants did really well. Fernando also did a really good job with the ball and then he supported Kusal as well.\n\n<b>Faf du Plessis:</b> Incredible game of cricket. Very disappointing to end on the losing side. As fans, that's the kind of Test match you want watch. Superman effort from Perera to get those runs. I think we were 50 runs short in the first innings and another 30-50 in the second. (On collapse in the second innings): Myself and Vern were batting that time and it was all placid. And then I hit the ball into the paint and they changed the ball. And suddenly there was swing. Yes, I know spinner took a fifer. But I still thought 300 was enough but great batting took it away from us. Towards the end we got a few balls at the tailender but there were a few plays and misses. One of them could have been a nick. We lost Vern, but with three seamers and Keshav, I would have still backed my side. But you have to give credit where it's due.\n\n<b>3.28pm Time for presentation.</b> \n\nPhilFour: \"@malik adnan: So did I, my friend, so did I. What a back-against-the-wall performance. He nearly pulled one off against NZ a few weeks back, what an effort by Perera - and by Fernando, who endured 27 deliveries to keep things going.\"\n\nNtokozo Qwabe: \"Great knock from Perera but extremely poor captaincy from Faf! Read the commentary again and see how many times Perera was simply allowed to take a single off the fourth ball. Extremely negative and fits into a trend of modern captaincy where the top order batsman is not attacked in such circumstances, and effectively left to dictate the game. \"\n\nThis is Sri Lanka's second one-wicket victory in Test cricket.

In the Aus-WI test of '99, Lara came to bat in at 5 and the target was chased with one wicket remaining, today Kusal Perera came to bat in at 5 and the target was chased with one wicket remaining. What's more, both of them scored 153*!!\"\n\nGary: \"So good for cricket, underdogs beating top dogs...love this more than WI beating Eng as underdogs are visitors too...simply love it..great game is test match...\"\n\nmalik adnan jav: \"m not lying i have got tears in my eys. love u test cricket . BRAVE PERERA\"\n\n<b>3.15pm</b> This one is for the ages. Perera takes Sri Lanka to victory, the record tenth-wicket stand in a successful chase in Test cricket. The last wicket stand was 78, Alagappan tells me, Fernando got only six of those, four from an overthrow. But he stayed, he survived. Like Walsh at times as I said earlier, and guess how many Perera ended with - 153*.
