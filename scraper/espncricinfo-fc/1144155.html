One holds the line and gets Imam to defend inside the line. This was the reason he went around the wicket. Belts it in, short of a length in the corridor. Imam looks to defend the off stump ball and gets a tiny, faint edge. Not much he can do there. Was defending quite close to the body too.

Shadab punched his way to 47 but it only served to reduce the margin of defeat. So, SA sew up the series 3-0. The celebrations begin in their camp. SA have leapfrogged England and NZ to second in the ICC rankings while Pakistan have slid to seventh.<br><br>\n\nSarfraz: We lost 3-0, but credit to their bowlers. They bowled really well. Shan Masood played really well, the way Babar shows his class. Shan and Babar were the positives. If you see Olivier is one of the best bowlers of this series. He bowled very well and he bowled fast.<br><br>\n\n<b>De Kock, Player of the Match for his equal Test-best of 129</b>: Any Test hundred will mean a lot. I've worked hard over a last couple of months. Me and Dale Benky have worked on a few technical things. Big man Olivier is bowling very well, he has done it at the franchise level, and it's a great show at the international level. The old man [Steyn] is back, great to see him bowling in full flight.<br><br>\n\n<b>Olivier, Man of the Series, for his 24 wickets at an average of 14.62</b>: Look at the end of the day I'm proud of my performances but it's a team effort. I'm just happy to contribute to the team. The Wanders has some bounce, so you don't have to bowl that short although my pitch map says I was short. Each bowler brings something. For me it's about bringing some different to this team.<br><br>\n\nElgar: This is right up there and extremely proud of the guys and it's a good way to start the year. Not too many Tests, but we've spoken at length as to what we want to achieve. Temperamental quicks - all of them - but we are fortunate to have bowlers who are experienced. They're awesome to work with. The support was awesome from the crowd. Even though people were potentially busy, the crowd was awesome. Pakistan's bowling unit it right up there. But don't want to take anything away from 3-nil.<br><br>\n\nElgar collects the trophy and the South African players get together to soak their thumping series win. That's all we have for you from the Test series. Do come back for the ODI series. This is Deivarayan Muthu signing off on the behalf of Varun Shetty, Venkat Raghav, and P Ranjith.
