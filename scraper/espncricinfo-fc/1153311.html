They've gone 1-0 up in the series, which now moves to Mirpur. The second Test begins on November 30. Do join us for that. Until then, goodbye!\n\n<b>Shakib Al Hasan</b>: \"I think Nayeem was brilliant in the first innings. Little contributions from Taijul and Nayeem with the bat was tremendous, obviously Mominul was brilliant. We won the small moments, that was crucial to the win. Whatever I do, I do for the team, and I'm lucky to have some of these achievements [when asked about being the quickest to the 3000-200 double]. Hopefully a few more years, and many more successes.\"\n\n<b>Mominul Haque is the Player of the Match</b>. \"We were fortunate to win the toss,\" he says. \"It was easier to bat first, and we took advantage of that. It became progressively more difficult as the match went on.\" \n\n<b>Kraigg Brathwaite</b>: \"A tough loss for us, I thought the Bangladesh team did very well. Our bowlers did a good job. I think the new ball was the key. We didn't build partnerships, that was the key. And when we bowled in the first innings, it didn't turn as much. It was a tough pitch to bat on. Main thing was we didn't get partnerships early on. I thought Hetmyer and Dowrich played very well [in the first innings]. Unfortunate they didn't go on for longer. [Gabriel] will be a huge loss [in the second Test].\"\n\nSalman: \"Definitely it's a pitch for the bowlers, especially for the spinners. It's very tough to bat on. But Mominul's first-innings knock actually made the difference. So player of the match should be Mominul.\"\n\nNahean: \"Mustafizur Rahman is my MOM!! Poor boy, play only as a fielder.\"\n\n<b>2.20pm</b> Just noticed these messages from our Bangladesh correspondent Mohammad Isam, which he clearly sent me before the Ambris-Warrican partnership: \"Bangladesh have never bowled out a side for below 100. Lowest total v Bangladesh is Zimbabwe's 114 during 2014 series. Last time West Indies were bowled out for below 100 in an away Test was in November 2000, against Australia in Brisbane.\" -- All those records will now live to fight another day.\n\nNafis: \"BD win by 64 runs and Nayeem/Taijul put on 65 in the first innings. Simply shows how crucial it was on this pitch.\"\n\nAshikur: \"I vote Mehidy for MOM because 1) Hetmyer's wicket & 2) Breaking the threatening partnership.\" -- I suspect it'll go to either Mominul or Nayeem.\n\nHafiz Qasir Abb: \"A fan from Pak. Cricinfo is such a jinx, whenever any team get in good position and I visit cricinfo, the team losses its partnership. But I cannot stay from cricinfo anyway. \"\n\n<b>2.13pm</b> Bangladesh have won by 64 runs. That's quite a margin, and it's all thanks to their performance over the first two innings of this Test. They established too much of an advantage in that time for West Indies to be able to recover. 204 was always going to be tricky on this pitch, and so it proved. The new ball was particularly hard to bat against, and West Indies had little chance of recovering after slipping to 11 for 4.
