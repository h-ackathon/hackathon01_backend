Boult has pulled off the catch of New Zealand's summer so far. 'So what if you can't take it at slip? I'll do it myself.' This was a length ball that bounced just a touch more to take the top part of Hetmyer's bat. That's only part one. This lobbed back towards Boult, who was nowhere near the line of this delivery because his followthrough was taking him away. But the moment he saw the ball lobbed high, he quickly changed tracks and transferred momentum to his left before diving full length to his left to pluck that one-handed stunner. Wow, words can't do justice to this. Outstanding from Boult. A gentle smile to soak in the wicket.

What a loose shot. Raval really throws it away. Cummins strikes first ball. A shortish ball that's really a bit too wide for Raval who tries to fetch a pull. And it's not short enough either so he all he can do is manage a drag back into the hands of Cummins who takes a sharp return catch.

Hope to see you join us for the one-day series beginning December 20 in Whangerai. Until then, it's goodbye from me and my co-commentator Shashank Kishore. Cheers!\n\n\n<b> Kane Williamson, New Zealand's winning captain: </b> \"It was great to put two strong performances in this series. Credit to the way we stuck to our plans. \"440 on the board going into the last innings where the wicket was getting variable, we wanted to pick a wicket or two last night,\" he says of the declaration. \"This was a good Test wicket, there was little bit off the deck. We saw how it played out. Fortunate to be on the right side of the result and yet learn a lot. Not a huge amount of Test cricket this year, but in terms of how we wanted to execute, we were superb. Ross's ton was a special moment for him, he's a world class player. To get us to get us to a good score and set up a declaration, it was a considerable knock from a lot of angles.\"\n\n\n\n\n<b> Kraigg Brathwaite, West Indies' stand-in captain. </b> \"They did a great job. For us, we didn't really bat well, especially in the first innings. I thought the bowlers did a magnificent job, obviously it was tough on their bodies. Kemar Roach struggled a bit. I did enjoy the captaincy, it was a good experience. The guys gave me a lot of support, but Holder will be back and we're all looking forward to welcoming him back. This was a tough loss, we've to be better with our shot selection.\"\n\n\n\n\n<b>Ross Taylor is the Player of the Match for his 17th Test century. </b> \"It's been nice to get there, but the main thing is if you get a hundred and the team wins, there's nothing better than that. It was nice to have some throwdowns in the morning and change a couple of little things which worked. We came here wanting to win the series, West Indies put us under pressure at different times but we were able to ride that. With a lot of big names coming in for West Indies, the one-day series will be competitive. </b>\n\n\nSo a little over two sessions is all West Indies could last. New Zealand's home summer begins with a 2-0 sweep. Neil Wagner the undisputed star of the final day. His bouncer-barrage is what set off this slide. It was some of the nastiest fast bowling we have seen in a while. What a series he has had. Career-best figures in the first Test and now again a significant role to play in this Test.
