India sitting pretty at the top of the Test championship table. Who said they've got two days off in Indore? Sure they'll all celebrate the win, but I'm told the Indian team is staying back in Indore to have a couple of sessions with the pink ball under lights leading in to the Kolkata Test from November 22. Do note that game will start at 1pm IST, and we will be live 11.30am with all the build-up and of course our new signature #LiveReport. There's lots to look forward to in the build-up. Don't  miss out on all of that. For the moment, this is Shashank Kishore saying goodbye and thank you on behalf of Hemant Brar and Venkat Raghav. Cheers and have a wonderful weekend!\n\n\n\nTime for a chat with the captains and of course <b> Mayank Agarwal, who is Man of the Match. </b>\n\n\n<b> Virat Kohli: </b> Don't know what to say (laughs), another clinical performance. Very professional with the bat, playing five batters with one guy taking responsibility is what we want with overseas tours coming up. Hats off to the boys. These guys (our fast bowlers) are on top of their game, when they bowl, it looks like any pitch is a good pitch, Jasprit isn't here but this is a dream combination for any captain. Having strong bowlers the most important thing in any team. The numbers and records are there for everyone to see, that'll remain in the books, we haven't focused on it. \n\n\"We're looking at keeping the standards up, motivating the next lot of players. In that process, we're pushing up the standards of Indian cricket. We don't care about numbers at all as a team. The mindset is simple, when you see a young guy coming in to bat, in Tests I know how much time it took me to get those big hundreds, so I know the importance of getting big runs. It's important as a senior batter to let them know to keep going. I want them to not make the mistakes I made as a youngsters to make them world class cricketers. The pink-ball Test is going to be exciting, will be a challenge for the batters. With the older ball, it doesn't swing that much so the bowlers will have a challenge. We're just happy to be among the first to play pink-ball cricket for India. The crowd has been brilliant, these guys give us the extra motivation to push extra when we're tired.\n\n\n<b> Mayank Agarwal </b> for his 243 is the Player of the game. \"I just hope I keep smiling for longer and longer,\" he says. \"I do practice my six-hitting but not during the Tests, but I do try and hit a few in domestic cricket. It's dream come true to play for India, grateful for the start I've got. Hope I can continue. It's great to have somebody who motivates you. When I got my first 150, Kohli was at the non-striker's end and he said 'nothing short of 200 for you next.' We've had three pink-ball sessions under lights, Rahul Dravid arranged those in Bangalore. Looking forward to the game now. It's going to be a landmark game for us.\"\n\n\n<b> Mominul Haque: </b> Toss definitely impacted the outcome, it's been difficult. We won and decided to bat, was a difficult decision. I have a lot of positives, especially Abu Jayed who picked four wickets. Mushfiqur was superb with the bat in both innings, Liton did well too. The top order batsmen had a challenge against a very good bowling line-up, so we need to try and play out 15-20 overs. We have no experience of Day-Night Test cricket, we'll just try and enjoy that game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia's fast-bowling trio just had a fascinating small conversation with Harsha Bhogle on Star Sports. We'll try and get the video for you very soon, but a lot of it has the potential to be lost in translation, if we just put up the English transcript. The presentation is coming up very soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n<b> Shami: </b> \"We enjoy each other's success. [On bowling with pink ball] What I try to do is to pitch it on a good spot, nothing special. I just try to execute good line and length.\"\n\n<b>Ishant</b>: \"There is not about being senior. It'a a healthy competition. I am only 31 but having played almost 100 games, the body does feel old. Looking forward to pink-ball Test, I heard in one of the games, Shami took five wickets in 11 overs, so I just ask him '<i> aisa kya hiya hai bhai? </i> (What have you done special, brother?)\"\n\n<b>Umesh:</B> \"The incentive for us at home is, if you take more wickets, you get to bowl more. [On his batting] We try to score as much as possible. If last four make 25 each, that's 100 for the team. Batting coach and captain just ask me to enjoy our batting. In Ranchi, Virat asked me to score quickly. I just went out to try and hit, it came off the middle and you feel confident. There have been times in England when I have stayed with the batsman. Now it was time to enjoy, so I just did that.\"\n\n<b>3.36pm</b> Another comprehensive victory for India at home - by an innings and 130 runs. The seamers set it up by bowling Bangladesh out for 150 in the first innings before Agarwal's double-ton took the game further away from them. Bangladesh's second innings folded just like their first.","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":69.1,"text":"Ashwin to Ebadat Hossain, no run, tossed up on a length around off, comes forward and looks to defend.
