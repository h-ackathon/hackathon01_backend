Hope you enjoyed ESPNcricinfo's coverage of the day-night Test. Hop over to New Zealand's chase of India's 324 <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/18808/game/1153692/new-zealand-vs-india-2nd-odi-india-in-new-zealand-2018-19\" target=\"_blank\">over here</a> for uninterrupted cricketing action. See you soon for the second Test of this series. Bye bye, and happy Australia Day to you guys. \n\n<b>5.15pm</b> <B>Presentation time.</b>\n\n<b>Pat Cummins is the Man of the Match.</b> \"I thought it was a really great effort this week,\" he says.\" A bit of a new side and new set up. Everyone performed so it was great stuff. I think the pitch helped a lot. Big thanks to the curators. That's a beautiful Test wicket. Really enjoyed bowling on it but I think just the discipline our unit showed. We built up a lot of pressure and I thought that was the best we've bowled this summer. I think the pink ball helps when it's swinging around a bit. Makes it a bit easier to get that fuller length. I was really happy with my consistency. Fortunately they nicked a couple.\"\n\n<b>Tim Paine:</b> \"It was a pretty well rounded performance. There's a few things we can improve on but for a young group and a new group coming together it's a pretty good start. I think Kurtis coming in looked every bit a Test player. The other two (Labuschagne and Head) have played a few Tests and you can see they're starting to get a little bit of experience and confidence at this level and I thought the way they played when we were under a bit of pressure was outstanding. We were disappointed after the India series. We didn't think we were too far away but we just let slip some crucial moments. I think that was the difference in this Test. We won those moments. Some big moments in the game. If you can do that consistently you win more Test matches. I thought the way (Cummins) bowled, regardless of his 10 wickets, I thought the way he executed with the ball, he got the ball in the right areas so many times and ended up getting the 10 wickets but I also thought the bowlers did a great job. Jhye Richardson in his first Test was outstanding.\"\n\n<b>Dinesh Chandimal:</b> \"We are really disappointed as a team. Our batting was below par. We all know when we come to Australia you will get a lot of bounce and at the Gabba there's something for the fast bowlers. As a batting unit we had to step up if you want to win a game here. That's the area we have to improve and we'll just keep doing hard work at practice and hopefully it will be alright for the next game. (Lakmal) He was outstanding. He always does a consistent performance. We just want to take the positives out of this. Suranga Lakmal's five wicket haul and Niroshan's two innings. Kumara is out for four to six weeks. So he's out of the next game. And Dushmantha is also injured. So we'll need to get another two quick bowlers. We are a young team. We need some experience. Looking forward to the next one\"\n\n<b>5.06pm</b> Paine calls his team for a huddle. Has a quiet word with them before leading the boys out of the field. Proud captain this week, as the hosts shake Sri Lanka's hand. Chandimal leads the visitors. The crowd of 14,274 having an early end to their Australia Day plans. <B>We'll have the presentations shortly.</b> \n\n<b>Jhye Richardson:</b> \"I didn't get much sleep the first night, but happy to put up a good performance. It's everything I dreamt it would be. The guys were outstanding, and we had support all the way. Cummins showed patience, used subtle variations. I just tried to create from the other end. In the huddle, Paine said that 'if we put in this performance consistently, we can beat anyone in the world'. Outstanding catch from Patterson, wasn't it? We missed the first replay on the big screen.. so we wanted to have a look once again real quick.\"  \n\nFrancis: \"Ashish he has 90\"\n\nAshish Gupta: \"With so much talk about Cummins performance and nobody realized that he completed 100 wickets in test even cricinfo didn't publish any comment regarding that.\"\n\n\n\nvikash: \"Someone tell me the math here pls. After the END OF OVER:50, SL: 137/8. One more wicket and it:s 139/10. How?\" -- Lahiru Kumara couldn't bat due to a hamstring injury\n\n<b>5.04pm</b> Handshakes among the Australians. A few hugs even, nothing too extravagant. Cummins finishes with career-best match and innings figures. He's congratulated by Lyon as they walk back together. Head tells him 'well done' too.\n\nBertrand : \"So what if the two of them tampered the ball, it's time to move on, and let them play their game, seeing this Australian side playing cricket has left a cricket junkie like me depressed \"\n\nel: \"Smith is the greatest test batsmen in this generation, better than Kohli, he will come strong and immediately. He will captain again cause look at Paine average less 20 this summer, getting out at duck and even losing at home to India. Plus who you gonna make captain?\"\n\nUncle Ernie: \"@Everton Martyn the ball was nowhere near the elbow, so it has to be a delayed bat deflection\"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":50.4,"text":"Lyon to Lakmal, no run, back of a length on middle, and defended off the back foot towards the non-striker","event":0,"commId":"350040","commSeq":305004,"dismissalText":"","pre":"Everton Martyn : \"The TV umpire's decision to give Thirmane out was an atrocious decision.
