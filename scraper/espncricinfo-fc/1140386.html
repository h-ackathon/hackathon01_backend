It's only the 11th time in Test history that no England seamer has taken a wicket in a match (excluding matches in which England didn't bowl).

A rare blank in the wickets column for England's old stager.

It's a really relaxed environment, you come in and get told to do it your own way.\"\n\n<B>10.22am</B> England's three spinners are speaking to Sky Sports. \"There were periods I found it good and some were hard,\" says Leach. \"There were tougher moments, but that's Test cricket.\"\n\n\"Things change quickly,\" says Rashid. \"I'm pleased to be part of this team.\"\n\n\"It was a good team performance,\" says Moeen.

And shockingly, it is England who have prevailed!\n\nHandshakes all round as the teams leave the field. What an achievement for England - Sri Lanka are not the force of old, it is true, but they devastated South Africa on home soil not so long ago, and they have been a force to be reckoned with on their own pitches for years.
