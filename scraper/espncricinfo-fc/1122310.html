Only 907 balls in this Test as South Africa complete a comfortable innings victory. Slightly damp finish to this landmark game, but that's how it goes sometimes. Lots for South Africa to be happy about, ahead of their series against India. For Zimbabwe, back to the drawing board. Here's Karthik's <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/18067/report/1122310/south-africa-vs-zimbabwe-only-test-zim-in-sa-dec-2017-2017-18\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> for you to catch up on. For now, it's good bye from Varun Shetty and myself. Hope you enjoyed ESPNcricinfo's coverage of this (sic) four-day Test. Tada!\n\n<b>6.11pm</b> Time for the presentation. Markram or Morkel (or Maharaj) for Man of the Match? Mmm. Let's find out. \n\nFirst up, the Zimbabwe captain <b>Graeme Cremer.</b> He says: \"We knew it was always going to be tough. When we saw how the ball moved around under the lights, we knew it was tough, especially with their attack. But we prepared, and mentally, too, but the end of the day they were too good for us. Against Sri Lanka and West Indies, they were flat wickets. So this was more about gearing up mentally and tightening our techniques, which let us down. I don't think we were overwhelmed by the atmosphere. We were surprised seeing the ball move so much, and we didn't assess the conditions. Just one of those things. We play a tri-series against Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in January, then Dubai and then the qualifiers. Work to do.\"\n\nNext, the winning captain, <b>AB de Villiers.</B> He says: \"Happy to return. You could see I was enjoying myself. Nice to get some runs, would've liked some more. Always a good crowd here, India next so taking some confidence out of this. My back is okay, not so bad at the moment. De Kock should be okay, the scans didn't show too much damage. He just needs some rest. Faf will be back for the India series, and they will all be fit so our selectors will have the good problem of finding just the XI. We bowled exceptionally well, we were quite happy with that spicy wicket. Still had to do the basics well, landed the ball in good areas for long spells. The slip-ers and myself were in the game all the time. Goes well with some time on our legs ahead of the India series. We lost a lot of late wickets, but we structured our innings well. Aiden Markram's in great form, and it doesn't seem like he's losing touch. Temba was good too. Overall, happy with our batting. The ball moves about late in day-night Tests, so it's important not to lose wickets in the evening. It's just about having the teams adapt, and understand the structures.\" \n\nNow, the <b>Man of the Match.</b> The award goes to Aiden Markram, for his 125 in the first innings. He says: \"Pretty tough wicket, but as a batting unit we had the best of the conditions. Was good to get stuck in there. It's been a good start to my career, enjoyed every minute of it. There are tough times and easy times, and helps you grow as a person. Happy to take my opportunity. Learnt more about my game, my role, my strengths and to avoid my weaknesses. You learn a lot when you're out in the middle, so that's what I wanted to do. It got easier as we batted, but I never felt in. Was a tough wicket, but got easier the more time one spends in the middle. Looking forward to the India series a lot. Very exciting for me, and it's how you want to test yourself. Want to fight against the best teams in the world, and there's a lot of good players in our team. Should be exciting.\"\n\nJigar: \"South Africa would feel they are deprived of not enough match practice before India test match.\"\n \n\n<b>6:05pm</b> We're done, 15 minutes before the end of session No. 5. This is the least number or balls South Africa have needed to take 20 wickets in a Test. It was also their lowest first innings total in an innings win  - 309 for 9 declared. They were still batting at this time yesterday. More such bizzare stats in our bulletin after this game. Zimbabwe finds themselves on the wrong end of all of them. A pity after they practically flattened South Africa when the lights came on yesterday - remember, they'd taken 5 for 37 when South Africa decided to declare. Completely outplayed after that, and making it very clear how much they are in need of cricket at this level. A spirited performance followed by a very painful date with gravity. The lights didn't even need to come on a second time.<br><br>","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":42.2,"text":"Maharaj to Muzarabani, no run, full and dropping at leg stump.
