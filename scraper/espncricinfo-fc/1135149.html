Sun is shining, weather is sweet....","post":"<b>1.11pm</b> It doesn't get much better than a 226-run victory, unless of course you're Rafael Nadal and you've just claimed a staggering 11th French Open title. Nadal's record at Roland Garros now: 86 wins and just 2 defeats since 2005. <a href=\"http://www.espn.in/tennis/story/_/id/23751481/by-numbers-rafael-nadal-wins-record-11th-french-open-title\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> for more mind-boggling numbers. \n\nThat's all from Port-of-Spain. It's the first time West Indies beat Sri Lanka in ten years! The party continues at Queen's Park Oval, but it's time for us to say goodbye. Post-match stuff on our homepages very soon. Be sure you check our match report from Andrew Fidel Fernando and everything else the two captains will have to say. On behalf of Shashank Kishore, it's Sreshth Shah signing off. Thanks for joining us at ESPNcricinfo. See you in St Lucia!\n\nPurvesh: \"All teams except India have struggled after the departures of their senior players. SL has suffered the most. I feel phasing out the seniors is the right way to go. Ganguly retired in 2008, Dravid & Laxman in 2012, Sachin in 2014. With SL, Sanga, Mahela & Dilshan retired in quick succession which was unhealthy for them.\"\n\n<b>1.03pm</b> Time for the presentation. \n\n<b>Winning captain, Jason Holder:</b> \"Extremely happy. Credit goes to each individual. It wasn't easy, the pitch, it was tough. But Dowrich put his hand up. The partnership I had with Shane, and then Bishoo played an outstanding knock and eased the pressure off Shane. Great lower-order contribution from the ground, and then we backed it up with the ball. I wasn't worried today morning, because the pitch was deteriorating. Knew our bowlers would keep coming, keep the Sri Lankans at bay, and we got wickets in clusters. Extremely pleased with Shane and Kieran's batting. Was disappointed when he got out for 88, but it's a new batting position for him. We can tighten up in the field - one or two missed chances at run-outs - and we'll like a bit more from our top-order, so can't ask for too much more. This is the first time this bowling combination has played, and it really paid off on a surface where you had to work hard for the wickets. But also credit to Roston, he built pressure and took wickets. Devendra was great too, and his job with the bat was second to none. Proud of the boys again.\" \n\n<b>Player of the Match, Shane Dowrich (125* in the first innings).</b> He says: \"Very good feeling. We played through the five days. The pitch wasn't easy, so had to work for runs. We stuck to our tasks, and it came out well. My thought process was to stick to the basics. I've been doing this in training, and it worked well for me. For me, consistency and being positive is what I want to continue doing. My batting coach, Floyd Reifer, has helped me a lot and that's paid off.\" \n\n<b>Losing captain, Chandimal:</b> \"We went wrong, our fielding was below par in the first day. Dropped crucial chances. But that's a part of the game. We need to learn from those mistakes and regroup fast. We can take positives - Kusal's knock, was brilliant as a youngster - and also Kumara bowled well in both innings. Credit goes to West Indies, they played some outstanding cricket over five days. Dananjaya de Silva batted at No. 3 last few series, and played some great knocks, so if he feels good, we may play him. We'll see how it goes...\" \n\nAj: \"We've come a long way in the last 2 years test wise but good god that no ball problem needs to be addressed\"\n\n<b>1pm</b> Lots of positives for SL to take into the second Test, but there are still question marks hovering over their batting line-up. Their bowlers showed heart, but failed to close out the first innings after dominating the first morning. Wonder if they lost a trick or two there. All out for 185 in their first innings didn't help either. \n\nThe pitch was excellent for cricket. Enough for the batsmen to earn their money, and plenty for the bowlers to tantalise everyone else. It all bodes well for the next two Tests in this series. <b>Presentation coming soon.</b>\n\nPradeep D: \"Spare a thought for Dilruwan Perera who was stranded at the other end and now he will be wondering if his place is safe for next test\"\n\nLion: \"Never thought this game would end before the Scotland-England match.... but what a historic moment that possibly awaits Scotland.. Absolutely nail-biting. Congrats to the Windies and their fans! Well-deserved and a long time coming.\"\n\nJawanza : \"Rally rally round the the west indies!!!! Well done boys we will always support u guys bo matter what \"\n\nChamara : \"Moral of the match : yes you need five bowlers to win a test match but you need at least 7 batsmen to save a test match \"\n\n<b>12.54pm</b> The teams shake hands as the Windies walk up the stairs now. Been a while since we've seen them dominate a Test match. Great for the home crowd. And <b>it's their biggest win (by runs) at the Queen's Park Oval</b>. Reactions, interviews, presentation, everything coming soon... \n\nTito: \"Following the England vs Scotland game simultaneously and it seems like when west indies take a wicket Scotland does too\"\n\nRR: \"Chase cruelly denied a hat-trick??\" -- Think he'll take the four Test wickets\n\nRakesh: \"Huff - Puff and they all fell down. The end came pretty swiftly once the centurion fell and a well fought victory for the WI which will gladden the hearts of the WI supporter as this WI team fought well on day 1 and day 2 showing a lot of grit and determination with the tail sticking it out with the bat and the bowlers putting in serious effort, all good signs for WI cricket. A lot of positives for this young team, a professional & clinical display of Good Cricket.\"\n\n\n\nNavinash: \"Being unable to see this live or online I must commend cricinfo for their hard work of keeping me up-to-date in all 5 days of this test match. We appreciate your hard work. Thank You.\" -- pleasure, N\n\nIan: \"Ooooh that Gamage review....\" -- We'd just be delaying the inevitable, Ian\n\nAnon06: \"WI win by an innings and 3 runs!\"\n\nNicholas: \"Umpire Kettleborough is having a game to forget. \"\n\nSD: \"Well, that's one way to Chase down the tail. Sri Lanka seemed to have a rather long one here.\"\n\n<b>12.52pm</b> Took only 20 balls for West Indies to take the last three wickets. Jason Holder's a delighted man, and the West Indies boys acknowledge the crowd as they walk out of the field. Can you believe it?
