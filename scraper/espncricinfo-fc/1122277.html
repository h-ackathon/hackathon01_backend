No doubt anymore about which session was series-defining. We hope you enjoyed our coverage of this game, it was a pleasure having you. Be sure to check out all the post-match content we have lined up, including match highlights. On behalf of Karthik, Raghav, Firdose and Monga - it's a goodbye from me.<br><br>\n\n<b>Lungi Ngidi:</b> At the moment it hasn't sunk in, I'm chaffed and very happy. It's been quick turnaround for me. There's been some good form in franchise cricket. When I got the call out I felt I was in good form. Luckily enough, it [the debut] was on my home ground. The support was great. [Stuck] to the basics you know. The odd one that nipped back was getting the wickets. Definitely wasn't the fastest SuperSport pitch but we had to make do with what we were given. We pretty much put them under pressure.<br><br>\n\n<b>Lungi Ngidi is the Man of the Match</b><br><br>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/video/clip?id=22129308\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH - Faf du Plessis post-match reaction</a> (Indian subcontinent and UAE only)<br><br>\n\n<b>Faf du Plessis:</b> It took a lot of work. I thought we were on top most of the time. Especially in the field, we did well. Our main focus after day one was to show character. We were very disappointed after the last 45 minutes on day one. Our chat was that we needed to show more character. We were a little bit short in the first innings. We needed to get 400 after the position we were in. But for me the vital part was in the second innings when we kept pushing what they needed to get. We knew anything above 250 would be tough and that's why our batsmen grinded. We're looking forward to Ngidi and KG leading this attack in a few years. [Better catch] Morne definitely! He's going to tell us about that catch over the next few days.<br><br>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/video/clip?id=22129183\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH - Virat Kohli post-match reaction</a> (Indian subcontinent and UAE only)<br><br>\n\n<b>Virat Kohli:</b> We thought the wicket was really flat. It was surprising. We though we have our best chance to put runs on the board. Especially after the way SA ended the first innings, we had the momentum. We should have got the lead. It's the batsmen who have let the team down again. The thinking it very simple, I wanna leave everything on the field. The 150 means nothing now that we've lost the series. Having not won the game, personal milestones do not matter at all. You go out there and you give your best shot. We tried our best and we just weren't good enough. They were better than us, especially with the fielding. <br><br>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/video/clip?id=22128932\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH - Ngidi gets Bumrah's wicket and hands South Africa the series</a> (Indian subcontinent and UAE only)<br><br>\n\n\n<b>12:30pm</b> Bringing you the presentation shortly...\n\n\nAvneet: \"AB!

Is it like that after penetrating through top order, fielding side turns casual OR the lower order plays with less fear OR top order - in order to show more intent - tend to forget the very basic rules of batting?

Hardly any resistance from India's batsmen, other than a top-class 153 from Kohli. South Africa managed to climb out of trouble with the bat. They were always going to be difficult with the ball. 2-0 is a fair reflection.
