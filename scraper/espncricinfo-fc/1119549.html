Both teams have nearly extra days now before heading to Lord's on Thursday for the second Test. A lot can change over two days, but whatever happens, let's hope that game can live up at least halfway to this one! \n\nAs usual, our superb correspondents will be sending in their stuff from Edgbaston through the day. Stick around for those, and if you're in India, you'll find highlights scattered all over. On behalf of Gnasher, Miller and Monga - it's goodbye from me.\n\n<hr>\n\n\nIn badminton, PV Sindhu will step out on court soon for her World Championships semifinal against Akane Yamaguchi, looking to make the final for the second straight year.

It feels like I'm dreaming. I'm sure I'll sleep well tonight coz I didn't get any last night. Lucky for Stokesy, he got an awesome start and turned it around. To be honest, I tried to learn a bit from Virat. Met Kumar the other day in the hotel and he spoke to me a bit about batting with the tail.  Playing Test cricket in front of this crowd, with these guys I have grown up watching - I am just looking to learn everyday.<br><br>\n\n<b>Sam Curran is the Man of the Match.</b><br><br>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/video/clip?id=24282195\">WATCH - 'Credit to both bowling sides', says Joe Root at the post-match presentation (India only)</a><br><br>\n\n<b>Joe Root:</b> \"I am thrilled to bits. It has been a fantastic team performance despite the ups and downs the credit must go to the bowling unit. The easy thing to do is criticise the batters. We knew that if we stayed calm throughout, we would give ourselves the best chance to win. We did a good job in staying calm. We made sure we didn't get ahead of ourselves and after three days of fantastic cricket from both sides it gives us a lot of confidence going into the next game. Sam Curran has a great amount of skill, very exciting and promising cricketer. It is easy to make an emotional decision right now, but we need to sit outside and decide for Lord's depending on the surface.\"<br><br>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/video/clip?id=24282186\">WATCH - 'England were relentless', says Kohli at the post-match presentation (India only)</a><br><br>\n\n<b>Virat Kohli:</b> \"First of all I think it was a great game. Glad to be part of such an exciting Test. Lot of times we came back, showed character there. But England were relentless. They made us work hard for the runs. Definitely could have applied ourselves better, but I'm proud of the fight. Haven't had the time to speak [to the team] but it'll be about taking the positives. We can be proud of the team for starting like that in a big series.\n\nLot to learn from the lower order - Ishant and Umesh getting stuck in there. Those sort of things make you look in the mirror as a top order batsman. We've got to be positive, fearless and take the negatives out.\n\nFrom the team's point of view, the century was probably up there. Second-best to Adelaide. One that I'll remember. When you take your team close, it always feels good. Test match cricket is lovely. It's my favourite. There's nothing better than testing yourself against top quality for five days.\"\n\n<hr>\n<a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/video/clip?id=24282030\">WATCH - Emotionally spent Stokes left speechless after England's win (India only)</a>\n\nAn emotionally spent <B>Ben Stokes</b>: <br>\"I thought we are a bit behind with the lead but Sam Curran took them out of play, the way that he played at such a young age, that was the big turning point of this test match.\n\nIt's great to be a part of this game, but I dunno...I don't know what to be feeling right now\n\nThroughout the whole innings...Kohli played a brilliant knock in the first innings, but with the ball swinging he was trying to move across to play for that inswinger but actually the one that I was trying to swing away, he maybe leant over and missed one for a change. \nMoemnets like that change the game in these tight ones. I'm proud to be part of this group, playing for England means so much, and it's a great start to this tough five-match series. And being 1-0 up we're in the box seat at the moment\n\nWe weren't quite sure what to expect here. Knew we needed five wickets and we had all the confidence, These games are brilliant. We've copped a lot of stick as a team recently and beating a team like India there has closed a few mouths.\n\nWinning those tight games, you can't under-estimate what it gives teams for confidence. We've got a five-Test match series here, so we'll take all the confidence we can. No better way to start it off than that.\"<bR><br>\n\n<hr>\n\nJohn: \"Stokes a bit lost for words talking to Ian Ward after the game. I wonder whether he's thinking about the fact that he won't be there for the next game, assuming that his court case is on schedule.\"<bR><br>Alfred: \"To state the obvious - this needs to be on free-to-air!\"<br><br>Dhaval : \"Kohli's India know exactly what to mend in the next Test. Their bowlers set them up. It's the batsmen that need to improve. And of course the catching. And may be a little bit of team selection. I hope to see Pujara in the next Test. \"<bR><br>DJ: \"All rounders proved to be the difference. Where Stokes matched up with Ashwin in terms of bowling, Curran was well ahead of Pandya in his game.\"<br><br>santosh battula: \"I'm weak-hearted!\"<br><br>Devine : \"This match has knocked a few years off my life expectancy \"Shagird Patel: \"No hard feelings India...

A corporate English sigh of relief!!\"<br><br>Josh: \"What an endorsement for test cricket!\"<br><br>RobJ: \"Well played every single one of you. What a fantastic test!\"<br><br>Vatsala: \"I hope that Indian bowlers not being able to get tail-enders out cheaply doesn't distract us from the fact that our top order was pretty absymal, with the notable exception of Kohli. I hope the selectors bring Pujara back.\"<br><br>Steve Lawrence: \"Virat 200 runs other 10 Indians combined 122 runs. Man of the match? Not much of a match without him! \"<br><br>Nishant: \"What a Test Match it has been!!!! Well played Kohli and bowlers. If only had few other batsman contributed, it could have been a different ending.\"<br><br>\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/video/clip?id=24282001\">WATCH - Pandya nicks to slip as England celebrate nervous win (India only)</a><br><br>\n\n<b>12:32pm</b> Handshakes from the players. India led by a dejected Kohli. Those players - both teams - know what they've just been through. No overt celebrations. It's been so well fought. The crowd are on their feet, the English contingent singing. What a match. Pulled along, at different points, by different champions. Top individual performances from Root and Bairstow, before Ashwin ripped through England in the first innings. Then, the Kohli show. Will anyone who witnessed it ever forget his 149? I'd bet against it. He kept India in the game, one that would probably not have made it to the fourth day without his innings. Ishant Sharma had his own skills to show after that. England, with a 13-run advantage, crumbled against him to 87 for 7. Then, Sam Curran happened. Wickets AND runs for the 20-year-old. If Kohli kept India in it, Curran wasn't far behind for England yesterday. To finish it all, Ben Stokes, who likely won't play the next Test, who came in and produced the goods after a nervous start to the day - he got Kohli and Pandya. On a day like this, that is guaranteed glory.
