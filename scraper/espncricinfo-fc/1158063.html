The champagne corks are popping and West Indies deserve to celebrate. Ranked No. 8 in the world, they may be, but this side are on the up... England, meanwhile, have been left winded and wounded, the shine of their 3-0 win in Sri Lanka long gone. <a href=http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/18913/report/1158063/west-indies-vs-england-2nd-test-england-tour-of-wi-2018-19 targt=_blank>Valkerie's report</a> will provide the long and the short of a dramatic day, and George has already filed with <a href=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/25908096/outclassed-fought-england-boy-racers-run-road target=_blank>some hard words for England's boy racers</a>. Thanks for your contributions to a rip-roaring Antigua Test - Miller and myself will be back for more next week. Cheerio!\n\n<b>4.50pm:</b> Time for the presentations, starting with England captain <b>Joe Root</b>: \"We've been outperformed again and that's hard to take, I thought as a bowling group we've performed well but the batting hasn't been up to it. [Lost toss?] I would have bowled, might have made a difference, you don't know. Ultimately West Indies had that opportunity and exploited it. You've got to look at what you can control, make sure you're managing those moment as well as possible. [Next week?] We can put in a really good performance and try and win that game, been a very disappointing performance with the bat, and last week, need to try and right some wrongs. They know these conditions very well and they've exploited them to their advantage and are fully deserving of winning the series.\"\n\n<b>Kemar Roach</b> is named Man of the Match: \"Special award, I think a series win at home is fantastic, against England, No. 3 in the world. [Bowling to left-handers] My angles, moving the ball away from the batsman, working on it for a long time and it's been going well. Sometimes my rhythm is off but a change of ends brought luck for me. [Like this ground?] Gives a bit for the fast bowlers, moves around and variable bounce, like to play here and win matches for West Indies. Been a fantastic win, want to congratulate all the boys and the staff.\"\n\nWest Indies captain <b>Jason Holder</b>: \"Difficult to describe [emotions], we tried to push on this morning, Alzarri's mum passed away, so we rallied around each other, we wanted to do it for her. For Alzarri to be involved, credit to him and his family. We're hungry for success, we've been together for the last year-and-a-half, two years, credit to the boys for sticking to the task. We fought back after the tour of Bangladesh, get some honesty in the dressing room, credit to the individuals in the dressing room and the management team as well. [Personal success] Been an up-and-down journey but one I've thoroughly enjoyed. Been through tough periods but my team-mates helped me get through it. I can''t be here without them, hopefully we stay together for a long time. [Third Test?] Sticking to our plans, being consistent, important to continue the process, recover well and turn up next week. Massive thank you, exceptional support, the people of Antigua have been with us through the three days, so thank you.\"\n\n\n<b>4.35pm:</b> Here come the rest of the West Indies players, Jason Holder leading the way. The flags are flying in the stands, West Indian maroon, Antiguan red - and, following the handshakes, the Windies are off on a well-deserved victory lap. They have been <i>stonkingly good</i> over the last week or so, and deserve to wrap up the series, their first win over England since 2009. Pretty good #10YearChallenge, that. Holder let out a roar of celebration as Campbell's six soared off the bat, and this is a victory in his image. He didn't want to contemplate the series win before this game, but he can drink it in right now. Two thumping wins and England haven't had a sniff.\n\n\"The difference between two sides will be easy to understand if one looks at the strike rates of batsmen who crossed 40 in first innings,\" declares Gary, \"when English batsmen were put under pressure they choose to attack on other side West Indian batsmen applied themselves and dug in...and that is why they are on winning side\"\n\n\"Certainly a proud moment for the Great West Indians. The T20 franchise freelance windies players must make themselves available for the tests. Convey your message to the Boss of selection committee today itself.\" They don't need 'em, Rajesh Lokhande. They've got Holder and his band of boyos\n\nHere's Balasubramanian: \"85 is the lowest target that was successfully defended by Australia against England in The Oval, 1882!\" For future reference\n\n\"So what changes can England realistically make for the next match? Perhaps Woakes for Curran to play their strongest fast bowling hand? Hard to see what else they can actually do unless they want to jettison Denly after one match and bring in Roy.\" This was a much better-balanced team, DavidS, West Indies have simply been better\n<br><br>","hasVideoId":false}],"overNo":3,"completed":false},{"comments":[{"timeStamp":1.6,"text":"Broad to Campbell, 1 leg bye, pitched up, a touch leg side and skidding into the pads...
