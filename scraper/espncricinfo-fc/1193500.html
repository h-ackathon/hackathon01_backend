If you're craving more cricket, click here to follow <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/19430/game/1183531/australia-vs-pakistan-2nd-test-icc-world-test-championship-2019-2021\" target=\"_blank\">Australia v Pakistan</a> in Adelaide.\n\n<B>Presentation ceremony</b><BR><BR><B>Rashid Khan, the losing captain:</b> \"I think, what I've seen, we've been struggling in the longer formats. Especially in batting. That's the only area we need to improve. Once we do that, we can trouble good sides. Still early days in our Test careers, only our fourth game, against an experienced Windies. Hope to recover from our mistakes. We want more Tests. The more we play Tests and ODIs, the better it is. Just one Test per year isn't good enough. Hamza Hotak did well in first-class cricket in last three years, and so he was rewarded. We miss Nabi, but Hotak did the job for us. Great talent for us in the future. We are not taking our batting innings long. People are getting out for thirties and forties. We need to work on that. Overall, quite disappointing. And we will try to bring the improvements, <i>Inshallah</i>. Our main focus is now on the Asia Cup and the T20 World Cup.\"<BR><BR><B>Rahkeem Cornwall is the Man of the Match.</b> He says, \"Very happy. Just my second Test and getting my ten-wicket haul. Must thank The Lord. Playing for West Indies is everyone's dream as a youngster. Need to take this as far as I can. The India series was a good one. Pitches back home are similar. so the India series helped. Everyone at home is full of joy. They are celebrating at home. Just want to say thanks for the support. Runs will come, hope to put in a good performance with the bat as well.\"<BR><BR><B>Jason Holder, the winning captain:</b> \"Really important win, you know. We had a tough series against India. Was important to finish the year well. Credit to the boys, they stuck together well. Very pleasing to see new guys come in and take the opportunity. Shamarh did that. He scored a fifty in the last innings and followed it with a hundred here. It was full of class. And then Rahkeem getting seven in the first innings, in just his second Test, is amazing. The toss decision was just a gut feeling. I had a practice game some days ago, and that prompted my decision. We didn't get the new-ball wickets as we wanted, but the spinners delivered. Warrican was also key, with control, so that Cornwall could take wickets. Simmons has been a pivotal member. I've worked with him in the past. We've got a good group going. The whole management staff has been excellent. We've got good unity, we have a one-team motive. Once we love one another, the job becomes much easier on the cricket field. Hope it continues.\"\n\n<B>10.35am</b> The teams now shake hands. The camera focuses on Brooks and we can see him getting congratulated by Holder. He receives a stump as a souvenir. \n\nPramodh: \"I am one of those extremely disappointed folks seeing Afg play the way they did. Thought they had learnt their lessons against Banglas. Or maybe Windies played reaaaallly well, which is a welcome sign\n\nAnon06: \"Unfortunate that with some new-found momentum, WI won't be playing a test for 7 months. Not sure why a test or 2 wasn't scheduled against Ireland for their visit in January.\"\n\n<B>10.32am</b> And West Indies take 62 minutes on the third day to wrap the Test match up. Jason Holder was nearly unplayable today morning, and the target of 31 was only formalities for West Indies. Stick around for word from the two captains. PS. Who will be your Man of the Match? Two big contenders: Brooks and Cornwall.","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":6.1,"text":"Amir Hamza to Campbell, no run, full on off, from around the wicket.
