Rarely does nothing happening appear so gripping, so congratulations to New Zealand for putting the Test and the series to bed. <a href=http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/10883/report/1115781/new-zealand-vs-england-2nd-test-england-tour-of-australia-and-new-zealand-2017 target=_blank>Miller has written up his report</a>, and there'll be more odes to the game to come from Gnasher. Thanks for your company, it's been well worth the sleep deprivation and RSI. New Zealand's home summer is done with, England's set to begin in a few short weeks - we'll be back to bring you all of it, of course. Until then, from Miller, Gnasher and myself, it's goodnight and good luck. Cheerio!\n\n<b>6.15pm:</b> Time for the presentations, <b>Tim Southee</b> is Man of the Match: \"[Feeling?] Bit better now after that, rough couple of days but worth it in the end. It's come out nicely, good to get the whites on and see the ball move around it bit, good way to hose down the summer. [Boult?] We played a lot of cricket together, it's a partnership we enjoy, pleasing to be able to contribute to a series win. [Beating England?] Very special, first time in a while, first time for us, something we'll enjoy and savour for a long time.\"\n\n<b>Trent Boult</b> is Man of the Series: \"Phenomenal effort, credit to England, great fun to get over the line at the end. Myself and Tim, bowling together on these surfaces, we enjoy it. Sure we'll enjoy celebrating tonight. Test cricket is my favourite format, be nice to have a few more but been four goodies this summer.\"\n\nEngland captain <b>Joe Root</b>: \"Threw everything at NZ, very proud as a group and how we went about it, fair play to NZ. Bar that first inns [in Auckland] it has been very close, very frustrating that we let ourselves down. We've played some good cricket and showed what we're about. [Long time away?] You get used to it as a Test cricketer, you want to play in big series and we've had the opportunity. Hasn't gone as well as we'd liked. We'll take the good stuff from this week into the summer. Thought this was a great advert for Test cricket. Shame [not to win], but that's the way it is. Very proud of way we went about it, tried a number of things, few balls just out of reach and you need a bit of luck.\"\n\nNew Zealand captain <b>Kane Williamson</b>: \"Amazing day of Test cricket. First let me thank the England team, hard fought series and it was so close through these matches, for it to come down to a day like this, was really special for the format. We didn't get off to the best start, first two balls we thought it could be a tough day. Lots of steel shown by the guys in the middle order and the two guys in the last session, phenomenal effort, England threw everything against us and they withstood it, an unbelievable effort. The bowling attack has been brilliant. Fantastic series, nice to be on the right side. Would have been nice to have a third Test, we've had some great games, lot of good white-ball games, so on the whole a good summer.\"\n\n\nYes! The umpires are saying that's it... <b>New Zealand secure the draw!</b> Sodhi punches the air, walks off to generous applause; the eighth-wicket pair batted through more than 31 overs to seal the series, their first victory over England since 1999! Williamson shakes Sodhi's hand, slaps him on the back, beaming through his beard... England can't say they didn't have a fair old crack, but NZ hang on, with two wickets in the bank and just about nothing left in the tank (or that may just be me).\n\nHere's the hero of the last few hours, <b>Ish Sodhi</b>: \"Yeah, rapped, bit of drama at the end, Waggy was really good through those tough periods, he's a fighter and dragged me along with him. I was just think about playing straight, there were tough periods but we got through them. Waggy kept me going, five more minutes, ten more minutes. We're just rapped for the series win. My fingers are pretty sore right now, all that intensity out there and you take it on the chin. Series wins against England don't come around very often, to be able to contribute is massive for me. All I could hear was the Barmy Army at the end, their songs were ringing in my head.\"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":124.3,"text":"Root to Wagner, no run, Root floats the ball up full, smothered","event":0,"commId":"4124030","commSeq":412403,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":124.2,"text":"Root to Wagner, no run, tossed up and defended","event":0,"commId":"4124020","commSeq":412402,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":124.1,"text":"Root to Wagner, no run, Wagner blocks and raises his ton","event":0,"commId":"4124010","commSeq":412401,"dismissalText":"","pre":"Last over of the day, I think.
