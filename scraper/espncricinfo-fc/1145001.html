He's out hit wicket I think!</b> It's the short ball again, Dhananjaya is beaten for pace as he tries to pull. The ball glances off the glove or helmet and then as the bat swings around it clatters into the top of the stumps. Must have taken the helmet because Paine caught it. Either way, it's out. Not sure why Dhananjaya hung around, really, but was a very quick confirmation from the third umpire. Was clearly in the motion of playing the stroke, which is what's required for hit wicket <span class="text-bold"> 180/4 </span></div></div></div><div class="flex-row" data-reactid="482"><div class="wrap batsmen" data-reactid="483"><div class="cell batsmen" data-reactid="484"><a name="&amp;lpos=cricket:game:scorecard:player" href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/429754.html" title="View the player profile of Niroshan Dickwella" data-reactid="485">N Dickwella &dagger;</a></div><div class="cell commentary" data-reactid="486"><a class="icon-font-before collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#commentary-007-1" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="commentary-007">lbw b Labuschagne</a></div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="487">25</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="488">22</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="489">42</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="490">2</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="491">0</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="492">113.63</div><div class="cell highlight active" data-reactid="493"></div></div><div id="commentary-007-1" class="commentary-content collapse" data-reactid="494"><div class="content" data-reactid="495"><span class="text-bold"> 67.1 </span> <b>that's pretty straight, and given lbw!</b> Misses the sweep, but he has called for the <b>review</b>.

Something to smile about for the home side. \n\nThat concludes our coverage of this two-Test series. Sri Lanka now head to South Africa while Australia don't play Test cricket again until the Ashes begins at Edgbaston in August. Australia has two ODI tours to India and the UAE before the World Cup. \n\nOn behalf Andrew McGlashan, Binoy George and all the team this is Alex Malcolm saying goodbye from Canberra. \n\n<strong>Presentation</strong> \n\n<strong>Tim Paine</strong>: \"It's nice to get some reward. I've said all summer this group has been working really hard. I think we're starting to build towards something so it's great to get some reward for the work we've been putting in. It doesn't matter what the wicket is like or who you playing against. We were 3 for 30 in both innings and Travis Head in particular in those situations and Burnsy showed a lot of maturity and dug us out of trouble and put us in a commanding position. I thought the bowlers bowled beautifully together as a team. They built up pressure and allowed Starcy to really attack. The wicket didn't offer a lot but they kept smacking away and bowled beautifully. For our group to get some belief out of this will be excellent moving forward.\"\n\n<strong>Dinesh Chandimal</strong>: \"We were outplayed as a team in all departments. Credit goes to Australia. They have played some outstanding cricket throughout the series. They deserve to win. It was really tough. Especially in the last six months we couldn't get the right combination to finalise our best XI. That's one area we are concerned. That's part of the game. If you get the chance to play for your country you have to take it with both hands. We are a young team and always learning how to play, especially in these tough conditions. We will bounce back in South Africa.\"\n\n<strong>Mitchell Starc is Player of the Match</strong> for his 10 wickets. \n\nStarc: \"I just tried to come here this week and forget about everything and bowl as fast as I could. We knew if we stuck to our plans, we had some momentum from Brisbane. Patty has been great and so too Jhye and the batters were sensational. It's the perfect way to round out the summer.\"\n\n<strong>Pat Cummins is Player of the Series</strong> for his 14 wickets at an average of 7.\n\nCummins: \"It was a pretty tough series against India but we got a good break and came into this series fresh and I'm pretty happy with how they came out.\"\n\n<strong>Australia win by 366 runs.</strong> They win with over four sessions to spare. Australia win the series 2-0. It is their first series win since the Ashes in 2017-18. They have since lost to South Africa and Pakistan away and India at home. Starc was the star with the ball. He gets his 11th five-wicket haul in Tests and his 2nd 10-wicket haul. Cummins finishes with three wickets in the innings and 14 for the series. \n\nAnother horror defeat for Sri Lanka. They have to regroup very quickly as they head to South Africa on Wednesday.","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":50.5,"text":"Starc to Fernando, no run, 147kph, dragged way down the leg side","event":0,"commId":"450050","commSeq":405005,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":50.4,"text":"Starc to Fernando, no run, <strong>beaten and it just misses off stump!</strong> How did this miss!?
