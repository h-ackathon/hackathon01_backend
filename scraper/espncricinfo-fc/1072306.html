Including, of course, #PoliteEnquiries. Don't forget to pile them in on Twitter, with the hashtag of course.\n\nFrom Alan Gardner and myself, and Venkat Raghav the scorer, goodbye and don't forget to tune in at Perth next week to see if England can arrest their slide in the 2017-18 Ashes.\n\nMustafa Moudi: \"Starc's 2nd innings 5-For was the answer to Anderson's 2nd inning Performance but England had No answer For Marsh and Paine's Performances in their 1st innings and that was the difference between the sides\" That about sums it up. \n\nIt was a triumphant maiden day-night Test from the point of view of the attendance, however. A further <b>20,098</B> on this final day, making <B>a grand total of 199,147</B> over the five days. Superb\n\n\n<b>3.57pm</B> That's about it from us. It's been an absorbing contest, but the net result is that England are truly up against it heading to Perth, a venue where they have won just once, and that against a Packer-weakened opposition, in 1978-79.\n\nMayur Kulkarni: \"I predict this will be a whitewash. Not because England have lost this match. But these days almost in every test match we get results barring weather interruptions and sometimes 'Man-made calamities' and it looks like England don't look like winning even at least one.\" Who knows? It's clear from the first two matches that England have got the spirit to pull themselves together, but can they manage the consistency to counter an outstanding Australia bowling attack, and a captain in Steve Smith who is attaining greatness with the bat?\n\nJon Henderson: \"Time for the Foakes solution. The Surrey man's a fine wicketkeeper and stout lower middle-order batsman (far better county average last season than Vince and Malan). He takes gloves from Bairstow who moves up order in place of either Vince or Cook. Hope Foakes is at least given chance in two-dayer in Perth.\" Mark Wood is set to play in that game too. Although England's seamers rather redeemed themselves in that second innings. Nevertheless, the value of out-and-out pace in Australia cannot be understated.\n\n\n\n<B>The man of the match is Shaun Marsh</B> \"An unbelievable feeling to get a hundred on day two,\" he says. \"Looking forward to Perth, 2-0 up, looking forward to recharging and having another crack.\"\n\n\"We always had faith,\" says Steve Smith. \"It happened quickly, the boys showed some character this morning. Shaun was phenomenal in the first innings.\" \n\n\n<B>3.53pm</B> Time for some presentations. Here's Joe Root. \"The way we went about everything yesterday was excellent, and that's got to be the benchmark for the rest of the series,\" he says. \"It's disappointing not to do ourselves justice today. We have to make sure we are better next time.\"\n\n\n<B>3.50pm</B> \"There were probably a few nerves as a team and individuals,\" says Hazlewood. \"But Mitchell Starc took a couple at the top and a couple at the bottom. He's lethal with that new ball. We're working well as a group.\"\n\n\"Unbelievable win,\" says Nathan Lyon. \"What a place, what a venue, the best venue out there in the world. There's a lot of belief and confidence in that changing room, England will come back strongly at Perth, they're a classy outfit.\"\n\n<B>3.47pm</B> Mitchell Starc finishes with the superb figures of 5 for 88, and Australia have won by a handsome margin of 120 runs. England began the day with a distant dream of glory, but Josh Hazlewood scalped both overnight batsmen, Chris Woakes and Joe Root, without addition to their overnight scores, and after that it was merely a matter of time.\n\nLots of handshakes all round, and no small amount of relief for Australia too, who endured a tough fourth day, encompassing a second-innings batting collapse, and a sturdy England fightback. But England made too many errors early in the match, and that made it tough to stay in touch.","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":84.1,"text":"Starc to Bairstow, <b>FOUR</b> runs, utterly <I>smoked</i> through the covers!
