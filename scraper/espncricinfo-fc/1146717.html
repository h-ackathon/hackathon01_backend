He's been swinging it away late from the corridor and Liton's been patient. Until then. He left the last three, but Holder goes marginally wide this time to create an angle into him and induce a stab outside off.

West Indies secure an innings-and-219-run win in less than seven sessions. Shannon Gabriel was taken apart by Nurul, but the quick worked his way to another five-wicket haul. Nurul's rapid half-century and his 55-run stand for the ninth wicket with Rubel only delayed the inevitable. Do stick around for the presentations, which I will bring shortly.\n\nShakib Al Hasan: Very tough for us. But I think there are a lot of areas we need to work on. We were beaten in all three departments. We need to prepare ourselves in the next five days. Adapting to these conditions is not easy;we're not used to this. Nurul batted really well today. Credit to him. Jayed was impressive in his debut. He showed his character and can be a great prospect for Bangladesh\n\nJason Holder: Good to start the series well. I did not expect the 43 all out and Kemar Roach was outstanding. We had one no-ball in this game and if we have to be critical, we could have been more clinical in the second innings. Big effort from the quicks, hopefully they can continue. I'm pleased with my performance personally.\n\n<b>Kemar Roach, Player of the Match</b>: I have played a couple of times against them and know some players well. The pitch is of some help and more movement and bounce. I've been working really hard with the fast-bowling coach Corey Collymore. Shannon has been doing a fantastic job, Cummins as well.\n\nThat's a wrap of this match. Thanks for reading. Ciao.\n\nJay: \"RALLY ROUND THE WEST INDIES!!!!
