Also Saha in place of Pant otherwise why rake them on tour.\"<BR><BR>","post":"<b>4.37pm</b> So, that's all from us at ESPNcricinfo. Hope you enjoyed our coverage over the last four days. We'll see you later this week for the second Test. Till then, on behalf of Varun Shetty and Hemant Brar, this is Sreshth Shah signing off. \n\n<B>4.26pm</b> Time for the presentation. Ian Bishop's leading the interview.<Br><br><B>Virat Kohli:</b> \"Jinx excellent in both innings, KL solid in both innings too. Mention to Vihari too. We had to come back in this game 3-4 times, so that is a positive. Moving forward from Australia. Bumrah's workload is most important which is why he didn't play any white-ball games after the World Cup. He'll be a key factor for us as long as the World Test Championship continues. Shami is the same and Ishant is a banker, reliable always. Umesh is there too and Navdeep is waiting in the wings. We are settled as our bowling options, but managing workloads will be important. Vihari got a nod because combination is important. He's an effective part-time bowler and helps us when we need to catch up with the over-rate. We have a group discussion and then we decide what's best for the team. There will always be opinions about the XI, but people will know that it's in the interest of the team. It's a blessing that I'm in a position where I can contribute to the team in more than one way, but nothing is possible without your team. I don't think the credit can be taken away from the team at all. I am taking decisions, yes, but execution is done by others who raise their hand. We enjoy everyone's company, and that's the reason for our success. Jamaica is another opportunity to do a professional performance. We know WI will come hard at us, and we will try to plug the gaps from this Test.\"<BR><BR><B>Ajinkya Rahane is the Man of the Match for scoring <strike>203</strike> 183 runs in the Test.</b>He says, \"Feels special. Getting this hundred after 29 or 30 innings. The first innings was crucial after 20 for 3. We needed a partnership, and the partnership between Rahul and me was crucial. Bowlers delivered well after that, but this hundred was special in the second innings. My time with Hampshire really helped me. I dedicate this hundred to the people who backed me, supported me when I was going through a rough patch. I've been getting 70s, but getting a 100 means a lot to me. I think first day the wicket was damp. West Indies bowled really well in that session. But it was important to play as many balls as possible without thinking about runs. We wanted to bat 90-100 overs in the first innings knowing runs would come. In the 2nd innings, me and Virat wanted to get a good partnership. We wanted to just bat, bat and bat.\"<BR><BR><B>Jason Holder:</b> \"Bowlers did a good effort, but we didn't bat well. Batting issues to sort, going on for too long. Top order not doing well, leaving much for the middle order to do. Wicket was a good wicket, we should've batted better. Ajinkya batted really well, everyone batted around him. It was a difficult wicket to blast players out. I wouldn't question the team selection. We played the same combination in the last series and we did very well. I think we've got to blame our batting performance. We could've put up a much better performance. In hindsight you can say a lot of things, but we players need to take more responsibility. Bumrah bowled really well, one of those spells that will dislodge most top-order players. That said, we need to be a lot better as a batting unit. For Jamaica, it's a place we have found success and our players have done well. Hopefully we can do that.\"\n\n<B>4.24pm</b> The presentation should start anytime - stick around. Who is your choice of Man of the Match? Ishant delivered his third-best Test match figures while Rahane earned his first Test ton in over two years. This won't be easy for the adjudicators. Meanwhile, another stat for you: four of India's five biggest wins have come under Kohli's captaincy. \n\n<B>4.14pm</b> This win is India's fourth-highest Test win and their biggest win in away matches. <BR><BR><B>Jasprit Bumrah:</b> \"I am feeling very good. As a bowling unit, we came with attacking options. Me and Ishant were trying to use the crease too, to generate the swing. A lot of hardwork goes into my delivery. I used to bowl the inswinger earlier, but the more Test matches I've played, I've gotten more confident to bowl the outswinger, especially since England. I am always trying to evolve. This wicket was sometimes on the flatter side, that time we had to do things differently. It was swinging today, so we bowled this way. There's a lot of communication among we fast bowlers. We decided to bowl cross-seamed deliveries in the first innings. We have a good camaraderie, we all work hard and we all push each other. I was a little stiff in the first innings since I returned after a break, but things were all sorted by the second innings.\"\n\n<B>4.11pm</b> And with that victory, Kohli now has the joint-most number of wins as India captain, tying for 27 wins with MS Dhoni. He has also gone past Saurav Ganguly for most away wins as India captain (12). The Indian team management are now on the field, congratulating their boys. Kohli waves at the small Indian crowd that is there near the staircase. He even stops for a few autographs, which is rare in today's selfie-laden world.<BR><BR>Garry: \"For records, this is my 99th comment and if it doesn't gets published, I'll get a chance at century next time. For other records, I feel Kohli and India missed a chance to record lowest runs against India, less than 60 by giving bowling to Jadega and not Bumrah or Ishant. Also I would like to compare India's record under Kumble vs Shastri. <BR><BR>Tanmay: \"@Alan - Kumble is the best for me for the way he led India in that 2008 Australia series. Kohli second for actually winning a series in Australia.\"<BR><BR>\"Chris: \"@CHINMAY RIT whatever you said about Pant applies to Odis and T20s. Saha never looked like getting even half the runs Pant got in Eng-Aus.and Pant keeping has also been pretty good. his so called drops were exaggerated. Saha is too old now and Pant needs to play ahead of him looking at the future of India's test team. \"<BR><BR>Alan: \"Stats is quite misleading. Though Virat has surpassed Ganguly's overseas test wins, we all know the quality of opposition then wasn't same as today. For me Ganguly remains the best in this format followed by Kumble and Dhoni. \"<BR><BR>Iftrar: \"From 15 for 5 to 100 all out, it seems an achievement for WI today.\"<BR><BR>","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":26.4,"text":"Sharma to Roach, no run, back of a length, wide outside off.
