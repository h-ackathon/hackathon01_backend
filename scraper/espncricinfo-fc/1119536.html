Pakistan remain unbeaten in four Test series against England, while the hosts have something under their belt to take into the main challenge of the summer: India in August. Next up are a batch of ODIs, Scotland in Edinburgh and then a five-match series against Australia. If you've not had enough for today, <a href=http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/18707/game/1145982/afghanistan-vs-bangladesh-1st-t20i-bangladesh-tour-of-india-2018/ target=_blank>Bangladesh and Afghanistan are playing a T20 in Dehradun</a>; we'll be back for more japery in a week. Thanks for your contributions, from Gnasher, myself and Thilak, it's cheerio for now. Bye!\n\n<b>4.40pm:</b> Time for the presentations, then. First up, Man of the Match is <b>Jos Buttler</b>: \"Yeah, absolutely, great to be back in, brilliant opportunity, wanted to make the most of it and really enjoy the occasion. Think the bowlers were always in the game, there's always a delivery that can take a wicket, made batting tricky at times. Some fantastic players around, we showed that after a tough week at Lord's, showed everyone what the side is capable of, which is pleasing. Had the opportunity to try and slog a few, playing the situation. [Selection without playing red-ball?] I think I'm lucky, for someone to take a punt on you, that gave me confidence, to say there's a Test player in there, doesn't matter what you've been playing. Quietly confident in my own ability but nice for someone to show that faith in me.\"\n\nMan of the Series is <b>Mohammad Abbas</b>: \"Thank you so much, disappointed not to get the five-for at Lord's and get on the honours board, but if Pakistan had won the series it would have been the icing on the cake. But happy to be Man of the Series. Part of the game on a seaming track, sometimes you get the nicks, sometimes you don't. [England attempts to combat movement] I'll work on my bowling next time, they changed the ploy and got on the front foot, standing outside the crease, but I'll keep looking to improve. Thanks, and happy birthday to Wasim Akram!\"\n\nPakistan captain <b>Sarfraz Ahmed</b>: \"First we won the toss and batted, that didn't work out for us. Good batting pitch, but the first two sessions they bowled well and we couldn't capitalise. Not as disciplined as Lord's, batting wasn't up to the mark. [Hasan drop of Buttler?] You take some good catches, but dropped catches are part of the game. We were down 180, pressure on the batting side, but again we didn't capitalise. We have a young side, we learned a lot and inshallah will improve. The way we came back at Malahide and Lord's, I'm proud of my team.\"\n\nEngland captain <b>Joe Root</b>: [Pleasing result?] \"It was, we spoke as a group, it was a tough week and we responded well, spoke about character but wanted to play with pride and enjoyment. We learned quickly and adapted well to the conditions. Didn't win the toss, ended up bowling first and it went in our favour. A few guys stood up, think that was a good thing for us. [Senior bowlers on first morning] They set the tone, were fantastic and backed up by the group. When it came to the batting we were disciplined, good balance of attack and defence and that's the aim of the game. Came out and proved what were about as a side. Nature of the pitch, it offered a lot throughout the game, swung and seamed, made for some really good cricket. Credit to the groundstaff for producing the wicket, credit to the lads for their performance. I said we had a point to prove and a lot of hard work to do. We've got time to achieve that, this is a good step and chance to take it forward. [Three new players?] Think they did a really good job, Keaton played well first up, the two young lads performed exceptionally well, exactly what you want from your attack. [First Test?] We were below par, we know that. We were down on confidence from a tough winter, but we came back and showed the character, showed we were a better side. [Can you beat India?] I think so, absolutely. It's about making sure we continue to improve and have good weeks like this, taking confidence forward.\"\n\n<b>4.25pm:</b> Is that bouncebackability? Or just mercurial England/unpredictable Pakistan? Joe Root is certainly all smiles as he leads his team off, a first victory in nine Tests to end as grim a run as England have had in recent times. Headingley hasn't been their happiest hunting ground over the last decade but they did a good job ramming home the advantage after Sarfraz Ahmed's unwise-in-hindsight decision to bat first on Friday. Pakistan don't do draws away from home, and they were never likely to rescue this match once England opened up a near-200 lead; which means the series is shared at 1-1, after two strikingly similar Tests (with different victors). <a href=http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/18025/report/1119536/day/3/england-vs-pakistan-2nd-test-pak-ire-eng-scot-2018 target=_blank>Here's what Miller made of it all.</a>","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":45.5,"text":"Broad to Mohammad Abbas, no run, ooh, superb line, that's straightened past the bat with Abbas deep in the crease","event":0,"commId":"345050","commSeq":304505,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":45.4,"text":"Broad to Mohammad Amir, 1 run, arrowed in from round the wicket, Amir glances through backward square leg","event":1,"commId":"345040","commSeq":304504,"dismissalText":"","pre":"Sai: \"Who should be MoM today?
