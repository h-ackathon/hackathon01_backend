The caravan now moves to the limited-overs cricket. The first ODI will be played at this very venue, on December 9. West Indies would look to put up an improved show, while Bangladesh would look to extend their dominance at home. Isam's match report for this Test would soon be up, in case you misses some of the action. For now, that's all from us for this game. See ya!\n\n<b>Shakib Al Hasan is the Player of the Series.</b> \"Me and the coaching staff asked for exactly the same, overall, a very good team effort,\" Shakib says. \"Every batsman who got in, made it count. All the four spinners did really well. The way we bowled, especially in this Test. We planned and bowled accordingly, especially [Mehidy] Miraz. Nayeem bowled really well, the wicket column may not show that though. I cannot ask more from the team. I was too demanding and everyone stepped up. We have some tough challenges coming up, we look forward to them. I had trained only for one or two sessions before the first Test but in the second Test, I felt fully fit.\"\n\n<b>Mehidy Hasan is the Player of the Match.</b> \"I am really happy, after a long time I got a Man of the Match award,\" he says. \"Our bowlers bowled really well, especially Shakib bhai and Taijul. At the end of the day, we are really happy without that. I like to bat, but our main batsmen set the tone with a 500-plus score.\"\n\nWest Indies captain <b>Kraigg Brathwaite</b> talks about the positives: \"I think our bowlers bowled well, Gabriel in the first Test, Hetmyer batted well, Dowrich in the first innings [batted well too]. We needed big partnerships. Test cricket is meant to be tough, so you need to stay tough.\" <b>On the ODI series:</b> I cannot say much about that but the key is to remain positive.\n\nTime for the presentation ceremony.\n\n<b>2.40pm</b> Victory by an innings and 184 runs - that's the <b>biggest in Bangladesh's Test history</b>, and their first by an innings margin. That's just one-sided dominance. Bangladesh have been clinical and relentless. West Indies have been the polar opposites: listless and meek. Not one of them showed any sort of application for any extended period of time. They didn't know how to deal with the awkward turn and bounce, but what was disappointing was the lack of stomach for a fight. Mehidy Hasan headlines this historic day with the <b>best match haul for a Bangladesh bowler</b> in Test cricket. Fifteen wickets fell on this unforgettable day - nine of them in a session, which really set the tone for the rest of the day. West Indies had their backs to the wall, and they never managed to push back, eventually collapsing spectacularly. Shimron Hetmyer played a highly entertaining 93, but it counted for very very little in the larger scheme of things. Stay tuned, we'll be back with the presentations soon.","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":59.1,"text":"Taijul Islam to Lewis, no run, short of a length, blocked to silly point","event":0,"commId":"359010","commSeq":305901,"dismissalText":"","pre":"Himu: \"Akshay, can you please explain what's going on here?\" -- Two people are batting and 11 people are trying to get them out.
