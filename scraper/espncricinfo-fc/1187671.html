Alan's <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/19297/report/1187671/new-zealand-vs-england-1st-test-england-in-new-zealand-2019-20\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> will be available here very soon, and the usual searing analysis from our man in Tauranga, George Dobell, will be up shortly on the site. We'll be back to talk you through the second Test on Friday, but until then, thanks for joining Alan and me throughout this game.\n\n\"It feels great to win a Test match,\" says <b>Kane Williamson</b>. \"There was a huge amount of heart from that middle-order batting unit to get us to the 600 mark, which was our only opportunity to get us a win. For them to bat for 200 overs was an outstanding effort. [Santner] The talent's always been there... in his own mind, to spend so much time at the crease [and] to come away with his first Test hundred along with BJ Watling's first double was a magnificent contribution. [Watling's] application and his focus... the patience to make good decisions for long periods of time - it was what the team required. [On the bowling effort today] Apart from the odd delivery that reacted like you'd expect on a day-five wicket it was still pretty flat. When you're bowling for a Test victory there's always a bit more left in the tank. [Leaving the field] Just a niggle, it's OK.\"\n\nHere's <b>Joe Root</b>'s verdict: \"We missed an opportunity [in the first innings] if we're brutally honest with ourselves. Could have done with a score over 450, and using that scoreboard pressure as another fielder. We did a lot of good stuff, we just need to do it for longer - it's not going to happen overnight. It ended up being a good wicket over the course of five days... unfortunately, that first innings is what's cost us. We have to be honest with ourselves, not panic... the guys are putting in a lot of hard work behind the scenes. We've got an opportunity to level things up.\"\n\n<b>BJ Watling</b> is player of the match. \"It felt really good. The key was to get partnerships, and the boys stuck in there at the end. We tried to build as much of a lead as possible and hoped the wicket would do funny things on Day 5. Your job is to play the situation, whatever that is... it's just about turning up for that situation. I take a break every now and then, try and keep the body as fresh as possible. It was awesome here to play at the Mount, very exciting. [Keeping on this pitch] You feel like you're in the game the whole time\"\n\nGood spot this, from Liam: this was the <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=balls;spanmin1=1+Jan+2019;spanval1=span;template=results;type=aggregate;view=match\" target=\"_blank\">longest Test (in terms of most balls bowled) of the calendar year</a> so far\n\nBozza: \"good luck picking a MoM on this one!\" Tough one isn't it... I think if Santner had picked up a couple today he'd have sealed it, but it'll probably end up being Watling. Stick around here for the decision on that, as well as some post-match reaction from the captains.\n\n<b>4.49pm</b>: As for England... well, the Silverwood era starts in disastrous fashion, with yet another abject defeat away from home. They threw away a solid base in the first innings, underwhelmed with the ball while Watling and Santner went about putting on a mammoth stand, and then got themselves out in the final innings on a fairly placid surface (albeit one that bounced unusually on day five). \n\n<b>4.46pm</b>: What a brilliant effort from New Zealand, who wrap up a mightily impressive victory by a margin of <b>an innings and 65 runs</b> - crushing, by any standard. It's been their unsung stars, Wagner, Santner and Watling, who have taken the headlines, but the team effort was phenomenal as their stuck to their simple gameplan: bowl dry, and bat long.","hasVideoId":false,"video":{},"videoId":28158268},{"timeStamp":96.1,"text":"Wagner to Archer, <b>OUT</b>, short ball on leg stump, Archer flicks it away off the hip in the air but <strong>straight down deep backward square leg's throat!</strong> Henry, on as sub, takes the catch, and Wagner lets out his trademark celebratory roar. <strong>New Zealand are one away!</strong>","event":"W","commId":"396010","commSeq":309601,"dismissalText":"JC Archer c sub (MJ Henry) b Wagner 30 (71m 50b 5x4 0x6) SR: 60.00","pre":"Williamson is off the field briefly","post":"","hasVideoId":false,"video":{},"videoId":28158239}],"overNo":97,"completed":false},{"comments":[{"timeStamp":95.6,"text":"Santner to Curran, no run, ooft, not far away.
