So many heroes in a Test match that looked like a tight contest for the first couple of days, but then one incredible spell of bowling by a virtuoso leg-spinner turned the tide in favour of Pakistan in a big way. We had rain(!!), a delayed start as a result on Day 3, but not enough to deny Yasir Shah and Pakistan, as they clawed their way back into this series, which has been well-contested right from the white-ball leg up front. More drama to come, when the third and final Test begins in Abu Dhabi on December 3. Join us then with all the live updates, and your regular dose of commentary and feedback. For the moment, this is <b>Debayan Sen</b> saying goodbye on behalf of the rest of our team that brought you this Test - <b>Varun Shetty, Akshay Gopalakrishnan, Thilak Rama, M Venkat Raghav and Ranjtih P</b>. See you around.\n\n<b>3.48pm</b> Time for the presentation\n\nMan of the Match, no prizes for guessing, is <b>Yasir Shah</b>: \"I came to know yesterday (about Imran Khan's record of 14 wickets). This is my first major match in Dubai after my injury. I felt my rhythm coming back, and that allowed me to mind my line and length. I haven't bowled as well as this, especially with the pitch offering turn and bounce like it did. The attempt was to put the disappointment of the first Test behind and compete better. We just needed to keep getting wickets, and thanks to Allah that happened. I have been trying to bowl the googly, and hopefully I will get better with this.\"\n\n<b>Kane Williamson</b>: \"We batted better in the second innings, but that session yesterday when Yasir put us under tremendous pressure and put the ball in the right areas (did us in). It's about improving and we showed that. The wicket had aged a bit more, and getting 300 batting last was a good sign, but they did set it up with the bat. They played the conditions very nice. (The ball that dismissed him) Yeah, it was a very good delivery. He is an exceptional bowler, and it's important we learn some lessons quickly because we will face all the bowlers again. 1-1 decider back in Abu Dhabi, important to do that.\"\n\n<b>Sarfraz Ahmed</b>: \"We have to praise our batsmen - Azhar Ali, Haris Sohail and Babar Azam - because it was slow and not easy to score. The way they batted and set us a score that helped us. Yasir's spell was the best that I have ever seen in my years of Test cricket. (On team talk after Abu Dhabi) The chat was that when we leave Abu Dhabi, we have to leave the mistakes made behind. The responsibility was first with the batsmen to make some runs, and they delivered. Credit must go to Yasir, and the support that Hasan and the other bowlers, for how they bowled. (On South Africa) In four Tests here, we have had different bowlers stepping up and getting better day by day. (On the decider) There's pressure in everything, and toss matters a lot. We have to go there, see the conditions and then decide on our combination.\"\n\nAhsan Qamar: \"Do you know how long it has been since Pakistan last won a test match by an innings, provided they have been in positions to force follow on, on at least half a dozen occasions which they never did!\" -- Their first innings win in almost seven years, but then they didn't bat first against Bangladesh and hence didn't need to <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/12656/scorecard/538072/bangladesh-vs-pakistan-1st-test-pakistan-tour-of-bangladesh-2011-12\" target=\"_blank\">enforce follow-on</a>.\n\nMuhammed Riyas: \"Even though the match was one sided for its most part, to be honest, it would not have been this interesting to watch live on TV instead following cricinfo. Well done mates, especially Debayan. Hope you will be around for the next match and other upcoming series-es as well. Thank you for your entertainment!\" -- The authorities should be duly informed. There's a lot of fun guys on our ball-by-ball lineup, though. Keep enjoying and following the game :)\n\nLee: \"Pakistan last innings victory against England in Lahore 2005 right after famous ashes\"\n\n\"After a memorable series against Australia, Abbas is now having a disastrous series against New Zealand where he first have a wicket less innings and now a wicket less match\" -- Happens in every team sport, Khurram. He did create pressure with his tight line and length, and Yasir Shah and Hasan Ali capitalised from the other end. That's the right way of looking at his contribution in this game\n\nbrendan: \"@nRahman: So, by an innings and four-squared, close enough.\"\n\nAhmad Jawad : \"Watching it on CRICINFO from office in TANZANIA where people dont even know about cricket i punched in ear after getting Boult wicket My Boss wasn't Far enough either. Weldone Green Team\"\n\nAamer: \"So Yasir needs 5 to set record for 200, highly likely in next test match he can do it!!! Impressive cricket player\"\n\nBilal Khan: \"Abu Dhabi debacle? What debacle? What Abu Dhabi? *dances oppa gangam style*\"\n\npeter Codway: \"Thanks for the fun commentary, A lifeline for many. goodnight from NZ.\" -- Cheers, hope to have your company for Abu Dhabi, which should now be a humdinger!\n\nAwais: \"Imran khan had 14 wickers in a test match. Yasir Shah now has 14 wickers in a test match.. Upcoming Prime Minister? \" -- Make him captain for the 2019 World Cup as well, then, for good measure :)\n\n<b>3.35pm</b> Pakistan level the series, and it comes with an innings and 16 run win against New Zealand. Let's not forget how the foundations of this win were set by the Pakistan batsmen in the first dig, where Haris Sohail and Babar Azam in particular showed remarkable patience and maturity to build a score with which they could come at their opponents, and from there on it was largely down to Yasir Shah. His 14 for 184 in this match is second only to the great Imran Khan's 14 for 116 as best match figures for a Pakistan bowler.
