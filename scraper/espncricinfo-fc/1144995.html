</span> <b>gone, Vihari's done in by bounce</b>. Short ball, superbly-directed, into Vihari and forcing him to play at it. Vihari half-arches out of the way but hasn't quite done a complete job of it. Leaves the hands hanging up and the ball pings the glove as he awkwardly crouches and lobs towards the cordon as second slip moves back to grab it. Patient stay, did his biding but couldn't make it count <span class="text-bold"> 40/1 </span></div></div></div><div class="flex-row" data-reactid="202"><div class="wrap batsmen" data-reactid="203"><div class="cell batsmen" data-reactid="204"><a name="&amp;lpos=cricket:game:scorecard:player" href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/398438.html" title="View the player profile of Mayank Agarwal" data-reactid="205">MA Agarwal</a></div><div class="cell commentary" data-reactid="206"><a class="icon-font-before collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#commentary-002-0" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="commentary-002">c &dagger;Paine b Cummins</a></div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="207">76</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="208">161</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="209">239</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="210">8</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="211">1</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="212">47.20</div><div class="cell highlight active" data-reactid="213"></div></div><div id="commentary-002-0" class="commentary-content collapse" data-reactid="214"><div class="content" data-reactid="215"><span class="text-bold"> 54.5 </span> is that gone? Yup, given by the umpire. Agarwal stays put as the Australians go up in appeal. Ian Gould takes what seems like an eternity before raising his finger. Agarwal doesn't review but this has been a great start to his Test career. Coming to the delivery, it was short and angled sharply into Agarwal, who looks for a smart little dab. But with the ball climbing, he can't get on top of it entirely and only manages to send a glove down to the left of Paine who takes it smartly behind the stumps <span class="text-bold"> 123/2 </span></div></div></div><div class="flex-row" data-reactid="216"><div class="wrap batsmen" data-reactid="217"><div class="cell batsmen" data-reactid="218"><a name="&amp;lpos=cricket:game:scorecard:player" href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/32540.html" title="View the player profile of Cheteshwar Pujara" data-reactid="219">CA Pujara</a></div><div class="cell commentary" data-reactid="220"><a class="icon-font-before collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#commentary-003-0" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="commentary-003"> b Cummins</a></div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="221">106</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="222">319</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="223">481</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="224">10</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="225">0</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="226">33.22</div><div class="cell highlight active" data-reactid="227"></div></div><div id="commentary-003-0" class="commentary-content collapse" data-reactid="228"><div class="content" data-reactid="229"><span class="text-bold"> 125.4 </span> <b>keeps low and that's the end of Pujara</b>.

What a brilliant year it's been for the sport. We'll see you in 2019, but before that, don't forget to catch up on our <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/review2018/content/story/1169760.html\" target=\"_blank\">best stories from 2018.</a> This is Sreshth Shah signing off, and on behalf of all of us at ESPNcricinfo, we wish you Happy New Year in advance.\n\nVarahan: \"Thank you EspnCricinfo staff for creating fantastic memories in 2018..Looking forward to more in 2019...\"\n\nJeff: \"The amount of credit given by the Indians to their first class system is telling. Time for a revamp Australia!\"\n\n\n\n<b>1.28pm</b> The post-game presentation now. India, by the way, have retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy since they currently have the trophy. They can't lose <i>this</i> series anymore. \n\n<b>Jasprit Bumrah, The Man of the Match:</b> \"To play Test cricket is a great feeling: be it Boxing Day or any other day. I made my India debut in Australia, so great feeling. I always focus on consistency. When you have so many options, you may get confused. Someday you get wickets, someday another mate will, but we don't think about those. Bowled a lot, but I don't mind, because this is why we train. We bowl a lot in Ranji-Trophy cricket, and it pays off. When I made my ODI debut, I always just wanted to play Test cricket.\" \n\n<b>Virat Kohli:</b> \"We are not going to stop here. This has given us more confidence to play more positive cricket in Sydney. We've done well in all three departments, which is why we've retained the trophy. But we want to continue. This is how we played in South Africa too, and we're not ready for the final game. It's a good thing I don't read any comments or opinions (on not enforcing the follow on). I wanted us to bat more, and add some more runs, because batting would be difficult on day four and five. We knew that it would be tough for Australia, but credit to our bowlers, especially Jasprit. The three fast bowlers have broken the record for most wickets by pacers in a calendar year for a team, which is brilliant. I certainly feel proud as a captain when they bowl in partnerships. No one is looking to out-bowl each other. Our first-class cricket is amazing, which is why we won. Credit must go to first-class set-up in India, which challenges our fast bowlers in India, and that helps them abroad. Agarwal showed great character on Boxing Day. And Pujara has always been composed, so we just wanted a big partnership. And the fact that Vihari batted so long in the first innings, it allowed us to bat more confidently. And Rohit's 60-odd as well. (Can you be the first Indian captain to win a Test series?) Honestly I cannot answer that. Nothing can distract us from trying to win that final Test, because we've never been in a position to win a series. Thank you.\" \n\n<b>Tim Paine:</b> \"We made some strides forward in Perth, but this was disappointing. We're playing against some of the best bowlers, and we need to find positives before Sydney. Another huge challenge coming up. We had little discussions about the batting order, but conditions in Sydney will be different, so we'll decide on the best formula. The pitch was a good one, although some said it's a 'bad wicket'. I was glad I didn't win the toss, because I wanted to bowl anyway. Would've looked disastrous. Cummins has been superb all series. The quality was always there, but the Australian public can see his effort. We just need a few more guys to jump in with him. It's been a difficult year, but the silver lining is that we'll have some world-class players available for selection in a few months. And we'll see the benefits of what happened this year over the next few.\" \n\nShahz: \"Aus couldnt reach india's first innings score in both innings. India's first - 443. Aus both - 151+261 = 412 ! India won an innings and 31 run.. Lol\"\n\nSanjay: \"Thank you Virat for rubbing in the salt! \"Our first class cricket is Amazing\"\"\n\n<b>1.18pm</b> And Virat Kohli is jubilant! From first slip, he punched the air while running towards Ishant as soon as the wicket was taken. Handshakes between Paine, young Archie and Kohli. The rest of the team follows suit. Just 27 balls needed today to clean up the tail. A terrific way for India to end 2018 and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy will remain with them, irrespective of what happens in Sydney. They now lead 2-1. Stick around for <b>reactions from the two captains. </b>\n\nThe Indian team is hanging around near the field to thank the fans who turned up today. They've been a patient lot, braving the inclement weather. \n\n\n\n<b>Records watch:</b> Pant (20) now has most dismissals in a Test series for India. And Virat Kohli has just equalled Saurav Ganguly's record of 11 Away Test wins as captain. \n\nAnkur Shah: \"The question for India is, who should open the next match? Vihari doesnt seem to be ready for that role. \"\n\nAnkush: \"Despite being on losing side, my MoM is Cummins. What amazing grit and fighting spirit. 80 runs and 9 wickets\"\n\nryan Rattan: \"Have you ever seen any passionate leader than Virat Kohli? He's like the Steve Jobs of cricket right now. A visionary, a believer, a team player!! Love to team India from Germany. My gin tonics did pay off tonight! Well played\" \n\nKedar Kshirsaga: \"The real question now. Bumrah or Mayank. Who's the man of the match? I feel it should be Mayank. Indian bowling has been good for some time now. The batting from the opener has made the real difference.\"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":89.2,"text":"I Sharma to Lyon, no run, length ball on off, and he tiptoes to negate the rising delivery.
