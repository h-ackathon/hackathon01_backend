It's been a special <strike>five</strike> four days, and it's ended with a doughty performance from a young Pakistan side who found their heroes at the right moment throughout the contest.\n\nIreland have oodles to be proud of, however. Especially that man Kevin O'Brien. Don't forget to check out all our post-match coverage from Mel and Jarrod, including #PoliteEnquiries. And we'll see you next week for Pakistan's next engagement, against England at Lord's on May 24.\n\n<B>Time for some presentations</B> First up the Man of the Match is <B>Kevin O'Brien</B>.\n\n\n\"I think a slightly better morning for us and we could have pushed Pakistan even harder. I struggled the most this morning trying to forget about yesterday, it was mentally draining. I just played the situation where we needed to stick in and dig around. I'm renowned for slogging the ball into the stands but I reined myself in a little bit!</B>\n\n<B>Will Porterfield:</B> \"The 200 mark would have made it close, but full credit to the boys, if we'd been able to break that partnership earlier it could have been close. We had a hell of a lot of good things coming out of the game. I couldn't have asked any more of the bowlers, we'd have liked to have the opportunity to bat that first innings again, but we showed character, and brought that into our first Test.\"\n\n\"Regardless of what happens, we always talked about winning the next session.\"\n\nA T20 series against India coming up... \"A lot to look forward to.\"\n\n\n<B>Sarfraz Ahmed:</B> \"Batting is very difficult here so a great knock from Imam and Babar. We dropped a couple of catches but if we'd taken them... they made a good partnership, but credit to my bowlers and my batsmen.\"\n\nEngland coming up for Pakistan. \"We need this kind of performance, so in'shallah we are ready for that tour.\"\n\n<B>3.55pm</B> Ali Ahad: \"Pakistan have too few experienced player for the team of their caliber, Ireland have two many experienced player they needed young blood\" Not entirely untrue. But the combination has been compelling this week.\n\n\n\n<B>3.50pm</B> The two teams have just posed for a joint photograph. What a nice touch that is! And a sign of the respect forged between the two sides. A genuine feelgood match for a beleaguered old format.\n\nAli Ahad: \"Sometimes I realize how Important Pakistan is for the revival/survival of Test Cricket ... \" Damn right. They are the linchpin in my opinion. The most interesting team for the neutrals to observe, in awe, in shock, in laughter sometimes. But it's never dull!\n\n\n\nSwerver: \"Ireland may have lost this match, but they have certainly won respect. A better first innings score and this match could've been really close.\" Indeed. They were a touch paralysed by nerves in the first dig, but really settled into their roles thereafter. Batting at times brilliant, bowling forever tenacious.\n\n\nMaan: \"A one or two very important things Pakistan need to improve in up coming games against england .. firstly they need azhar to stand up Pak surely cant afford him being out of form .. secondly sarfraz need to improve behind the stumps .. he is not batting that well and then if he cant keeps well enough then surely its gonna hurt Pskistan big time\"\n\n\n\n\n<B>3.45pm</B> Handshakes all round, and rightly so. It's been a tremendous Test match, Ireland battled to the bitter end, even when all hope was lost they refused to offer any freebies\n\nStefan: \"Hey, at least this was a wonderful distraction from the seemingly never-ending, monotonously soul crushing, strategy breakingly commercial megabeast that is the IPL.
