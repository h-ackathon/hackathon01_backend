Gaffaney raises his finger after Wafadar gets one to come back in and hit Vijay's front pad as he comes forward and shoulders arms. Vijay has reviewed... Impact was definitely outside off stump but that doesn't matter since he wasn't offering a shot. Let's see what ball-tracking has to say. Umpire's call, it's clipping the off bail. Was that reverse-swing? Can't say for sure, but a very good ball.

Not-out is the decision, and Afghanistan have reviewed after much deliberation. No inside-edge - it would have been a catch at slip otherwise - and it seems to have hit the flap of his back pad. This looks out to me, let's see what ball-tracking says. Pitches on middle stump, hits back pad in front of middle, and hits top of middle stump. Rashid Khan finally has a Test wicket, and he gets it with a good legbreak.

Rahane collects the trophy and poses with his team-mates. Great gesture from Rahane: he asks the Afghanistan players to join them. It has been a harsh introduction to Test cricket for them but it will be a steep learning curve. On that note, this is Deivarayan Muthu signing off on the behalf of Karthik Krishnaswamy, Chandan Duorah, and P Ranjith. Until next time, goodbye.\n\nFor those in India, you can switch over to watching the World Cup on <a href=\"http://www.espn.in/watch/\" target=\"_blank\">on ESPN.in</A>.\n\nMel: \"And Ajinkya Rahane maintains his 100% win record as Test Captain \"\n\n<b>Rahane</b>:  This [win] feels really special. It is always an honour to lead your country The way we played, especially batting, Shikhar, Vijay, Rahul and Hardik. We did not take Afghanistan lightly. It was important for us to keep the basics and good habits. Credit to Afghanistan. Their seamers bowled really well, especially in the third session yesterday and I am sure they will go a long way.\n\n<b>Dhawan, Player of the Match</b>: Really happy about the way I've been playing. It's good we finished the match early and we have a few days off. Before going to Ireland, we will be fresh. Of course, the ball was swinging and seaming but I was clear in my mind and it went my way. By the grace of god, I scored a century in one session and it feels special. I want to congratulate Afghanistan for making it to this level and Eid Mubarak to all of them. It's always a learning process. Once they play other sides and start winning, they will get confidence. It's a big boost for their country. I would like to thank the audience for all coming here.\n\n<b>5.40pm</b> <b>Stanikzai</b>: Before we had not played a Test match, and now in the future against Full Member what we need to do. We were surprised with the match ending in two days because our team is good. Disappointed with the batting, but it is good for the future. We have a lot of times and camps to work on our weakness. Thanks to the fans supporting both teams.\n\n<b>5.25pm</b> <b>Umesh</b>: When I got the new ball, I was just trying to keep bowling length and get swing. I think the wicket was a little bit slow and I was just trying to swing it.\n\n<b>Jadeja</b>: Everyone was bowling well upfront. The seamers set the tone and I was just bowling in my areas. In IPL when we played here, the ball was turning like a rank-turner, but today's wicket was very flat and I was not getting turn. Me and Ashwin were talking about restricting them. We just looked to keep it simple.\n\n<b>5.30pm</b> <b>There it is - India's first Test win in two days</b>. Afghanistan's Test debut ends in two days. Twenty-four wickets tumbled on the second day in Bengaluru. Never before have more wickets fallen in a day of Test cricket in India. Afghanistan dominated the entire post-tea session on day one and parts of the morning session on day two, but their batting line-up crumbled twice. They offered flimsy resistance in their first innings, getting routed for 109 in 27.5 overs in their first innings. They lasted 38.4 overs in their second dig, with their captain Stanikzai and Shahidi sharing a stubborn 37-run stand, but the others could not find a way past sustained pressure from India. Umesh and Ishant found swing with the new ball before Jadeja carved up the middle and lower order with turn or lack thereof. Harsh introduction into Test cricket for Afghanistan, not the perfect tune-up for India ahead of the England tour either. Do stick around for the presentation, which I will bring shortly\n\nMradul Gupta: \"Dhawan and Vijay scored 212 runs combined in 41.3 overs, Whole Afg team scored 212 runs in 66.3 overs.\"\n\nAvro: \"At the start of the match, I was hoping that Afghans give us a mighty scare. And they have! If they can't learn from their first innings collapse, and produce such an encore in the second, I am super scared about their ability to succeed in test level. By no means is this a 100 all out wicket.\"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":38.3,"text":"Ashwin to Hashmatullah Shahidi, 1 run, picked off the pads to deep square leg for one.
