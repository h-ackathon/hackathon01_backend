That is sensational fielding from Kohli. Length ball just outside off, pushed past silly point and takes a walk down the pitch. Kohli sprints to his left at cover and turns around from the right before he picks the ball up. In the process he's taken out a few seconds because as soon as his full rotation is complete, the ball is out of his hands. And then it hits the stumps on the bounce. Sharp, sharp stuff.

Here's our <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/19430/report/1188629/west-indies-vs-india-2nd-test-icc-world-test-championship-2019-2021\" target=\"_blank\">match report</a> for the game. Till then, on behalf of everyone here, it's time for us to bid goodbye. Hope you enjoyed our coverage. Thanks for being with us. \n\nMaunik: \"Why no player of the series?\" -- No clue yet! The post-match presentation had no mention of the Man-of-the-Series award<BR><BR>\n\n<B>1.50pm</b> Time for the presentation.<BR><BR><B>Virat Kohli, the winning captain:</b> \"Pretty comprehensive again. We played good cricket, and getting the result in the manner you want is crucial as a team. We were put under pressure in a couple of sessions. While batting, there were some tricky situations but it took some character from the boys. Hanuma was the standout batsman, but Ajinkya in the second innings, Mayank in the first innings, Ishant with the fifty - it was an innings full of grit. According to the surface, Vihari's innings was top class. He looks confident and the dressing-room feels calm when he bats. He's always willing to improve and correcting his mistakes. Plays with a lot of heart. Up to do anything for the team. That's why he invariably plays crucial innings for us. Young career for him so far, but he showed why he's been backed by this team. Being the most successful Test captain? It's a by-product of the team we have. Our bowlers are amazing. Shami was great, Ishant bowling his heart out, Jadeja bowling a long spell. Captaincy is just a 'C' in front of your name. It's a collective effort. West Indies will understand the areas they need to improve. From a bowling point of view, West Indies were amazing. Kemar and Jason were their standout bowlers. If they get enough runs on the board, they'll be a very dangerous opposition in Test cricket.\"<Br><BR><B>Jason Holder, the losing captain:</b> \"Obviously disappointed. Didn't play a complete game in either match. Lots of problem with the batting. Need to put scores and fight out the tough periods. Tough question on how to fix the batting. It's an individual thing. Quite a bit of time till we play the next Test match so time for players to take some ownership. Pleased with the bowling. We were just commenting that we have been on the field in every single day of this Test series, and every single time our bowlers have delivered. India are a quality side. They wore us down. They knew our bowling was good, so they made us work hard for the wickets. And when we got the chance to bat, we didn't bat well enough. That's the quality of a good team, of playing the patience game. No complaints on the pitch. Once you work hard as a a batsman, you can score runs.\"<BR><BR><b>Hanuma Vihari, Man of the Match:</b> \"Maiden Test hundred feels great. Missed out on the hundred in the last match, so was focusing on a big score this time. We were 200 for 5 in the first innings, and that was my goal while batting with Rishabh Pant. You had to be patient on this wicket, and select the ball where you'll score runs. There was something for the bowlers, so you need to wait for the balls. Took some calculated risks against the spinners. Even in the second innings, the template worked well for me. I have not played a Test match at home yet, but I'm looking forward to the opportunity. Special batting in front of home crowd.\"\n\nAbhi: \"Kohli deserves his moment in the sun as India's most successful Captain. That brilliant run out changed everything !!\"<BR><BR>\n\n<B>1.40pm</b> Cornwall and Ashwin pose for a picture as the two teams shake hands after the contest. Ravi Shastri is seen chatting with a few West Indian support-staff members as well - good to see the camaraderie between the two teams. Looking forward to see who gets the Man-of-the-Match award though. Bumrah was excellent in WI's 1st innings but Vihari, who got a hundred and a fifty both times India batted, seems to be in prime contention for that prize.<BR><BR>pawan: \"Both wi innings finished under 60 overs so no deduction for low over rate. \"<BR><BR>Mukundan: \"Should have been a victory by an innings and 80 odd runs if there was a follow on. Nevertheless, well played India!\"<BR><BR>\n\n<B>1.35pm</b> So that's 120 points for India as they extend their lead on the World Test Championship's points table. It's their eighth-straight Test series win over West Indies. Kohli's 28th victory now takes him past MS Dhoni (27) to become India's most successful Test captain.<BR><BR>shiva: \"I cannot sleep in peace until i get to know who did kohli point at towards the gallery when celebrating earlier\"<BR><BR>Ankur Mehra: \"@shiva - Virat Kohli was pointing to a person in the crowd who was probably shouting or speaking way too much out of turn.
