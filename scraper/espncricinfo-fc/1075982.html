Australia were the better side but, the way South Africa came back at them, they'll know they're in a battle for the rest of the series. I'll leave you with <a href=http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/10908/report/1075982/south-africa-vs-australia-1st-test-aus-tour-of-sa-2017-18 target=_blank>Brydon Coverdale's report</a> on the last knockings, we'll be back for more later in the week. Thanks for joining us, cheerio!\n\n<b>10.30am:</b> Time for the presentations, starting with South Africa captain <b>Faf du Plessis</b>: [Always behind on first innings?] \"Spot on, they posted 50 runs too many, that's credit to the way they batted, their tail added vital runs. Both team were around 150-160 for 5. Our first innings total was always under par, that's the batters responsibility, not enough partnerships. To lose by 100-odd runs, we know we didn't have enough in the first innings. [Fightback?] First of all with the ball, we were really good, to restrict them to 220, then with the bat, Markram was really special. Really proud of our fight but not quite good enough to live with Australia. [Port Elizabeth next] The character of this team means we'll never go down without a fight.\"\n\n<b>Mitchell Starc</b> is Man of the Match for his nine wickets (plus some biffing with the bat): \"It's nice to put a few in the right spot. Little bit of work to do with the new ball, getting early wickets. Winning a Test match, I'll take that for the group. [Changing wrist position between orthodox and reverse swing?] I don't find it too difficult, probably more natural when it's reversing, it's a good habit to have. [Batting?] Probably got stuck in two minds during the home innings, but nice to get some runs, always encouraging for the tail to add to the total. [Bowl spin in bad light?] I didn't want to ... the skipper might have been trying to jag one himself. Just special to win a Test match.\"\n\nAustralia captain <b>Steven Smith</b>: \"Yeah, nice way to start, especially against a top-quality opposition. Really pleased with the way the boys played, Mitch Marsh coming in with 96, the way the tail contributed, that was obviously the difference in the end. A really good game of cricket. I think winning the toss and batting was ideal. Reverse swing played a part through the game. It was a hard-fought Test match, yesterday was a great day of Test cricket, Aiden Markram played exceptionally well, but when Mitch Marsh broke that partnership it got a bit easier. Our practice in the game before this Test was spot on and its pleasing to play as we have. There's not doubt SA will come out hard against at Port Elizabeth and we'll be up for the fight again.\"\n\n\n<b>10.20am:</b> Australia go 1-0 up in the four-match series - not bad for 20 minutes work. The wicket that eluded them last night was never likely to keep the tourists waiting for too long today. De Kock played extremely well, to the extent that when he and Markram were batting during the evening session on Sunday, it was possible to imagine the scales shifting - but really, having conceded a 189-run deficit on first innings, they were always hoping for miracles. Still, it was important they showed some fight, with the teams meeting again in Port Elizabeth on Friday.","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":92.3,"text":"Hazlewood to Morkel, 3 runs, full, Morkel slashes a thick outside edge through gully and they pick up three - he's off the mark!","event":3,"commId":"492030","commSeq":409203,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":92.2,"text":"Hazlewood to Morkel, no run, round the wicket, pitched up and Morkel goes for an airy swish, fails to connect","event":0,"commId":"492020","commSeq":409202,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":92.1,"text":"Hazlewood to de Kock, 1 run, length outside off and de Kock pops it in the air through point, this time they do take the single","event":1,"commId":"492010","commSeq":409201,"dismissalText":"","pre":"More news from this feisty old Test: <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/22650967/nathan-lyon-charged-de-villiers-incident\" target=\"_blank\">Nathan Lyon has been charged by the ICC</a> for his conduct during the AB de Villiers run-out on day four","post":"","hasVideoId":false}],"overNo":93,"completed":false},{"comments":[{"timeStamp":91.6,"text":"Starc to Morkel, no run, fired in straight, clipped square on the leg side off the inside edge - but they won't run","event":0,"commId":"491060","commSeq":409106,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"Morkel has now dead-batted six overs on his own, still without a run...
