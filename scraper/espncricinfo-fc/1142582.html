The photo works are under way, a bright orange signage that says \"champions\" as Sri Lanka fly a flag. A champion performance it was. Thanks for joining us for the coverage - we'll see you at the ODIs!\n\n<b>Suranga Lakmal:</b> (as translated by Roshan Abeysinghe) Worked very hard and these are the results of that. Sri Lanka has some of the best spinners in the world and that's why we bothered the South African batsmen. Not thinking too hard about the captaincy.<br><br>\n\n<b>Dimuth Karunaratne:</b> I think the first few hours it came on nicely. But once it got drier and drier it started spinning. But I stuck to my basics and rotated the strike. We always take it series by series. Now we're prepared for the England series and then New Zealand.<br><br>\n\n<b>Dimuth Karunaratne is the Man of the Match and the Man of the Series.</b><br><br>\n\n<b>Faf du Plessis:</b> Yeah the guys played well in this last innings. Theunis showed it's possible to get big runs in these conditions. But Sri Lanka were the best department over the last eight days. But it's not all dim and grim. Kesh getting a nine-for, he's got a bright future ahead of him. In these conditions, you need runs to get together. Fifty or sixty in these conditions counts for a lot. We have only three partnerships over fifty all series. But you've got to give credit to the opposition who put us under pressure. Yes, in hindsight we should have played two spinners. Our thinking was with an abrasive surface, we expected it to reverse. Lesson learnt, maybe when we come to the subcontinent we need to play two spinners.<br><br>\n\n<b>Rangana Herath:</b> Of course, pleased. Especially winning the game and the series against the No. 2 team. [Yes] I like Galle and SSC as hunting grounds. There was not much spin as the ball got softer, but we bowled well. Throughout the series. <b>Everybody has the time to go and that's why I have decided to stop cricket.</b> There is one more series to go [against England], hope to do well.\"<br><br>\n<hr>\nRaushan Razik: \"SLn fans will miss the roar of the old horse when he retires in November as much as they missed the grin of murali.\"<bR><br>Tharindu Hasara: \"Well Done Herath Wrap up Series with world class bowling\"<br><br>Danny: \"I'd love to be in Lakmal's shoes. Call the Toss, relax and wake up to declare and roll your arm for a couple of overs. At the end go and collect the Trophy! Just the dream Test for every Test playing cricketer \"<br><br>\n\n<b>1:23pm</b> It's come a little later than was expected last night, and that is down to quality batting by Theunis de Bruyn, but it's a massive win nonetheless: 199 runs, just as good as the margin last match, and a fitting way to wrap up a 2-0 series win. Sri Lanka have been good in every session of this series and have run wild against a slender South African resistance. Runs and wickets, they've got them all. South Africa's batsmen found the answers only on the last day of the series. That is no good. Lakmal with the pristine captaincy record, Dimuth straight back into run-machine mode. Runs for Mathews too. Wickets for everyone. In the middle of that, a career-high for Keshav Maharaj, and the worst strike-rate in a series, <i>ever</i>, for the returning Dale Steyn.","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":86.4,"text":"Herath to Steyn, no run, full on off stump, inside edge onto pad and into the turf.
