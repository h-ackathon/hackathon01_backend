Kohli and his men now take a lap of honour to thank the Kolkata crowd. Great gesture from India's players. Also <b>nice to see reserve wicketkeeper Srikar Bharat hold the trophy</b> during the lap of honour. That's a wrap of India's home Test season. Hope you enjoyed our coverage as much as we did bringing it to you. Do look out for post-match pieces from our men in Kolkata - Varun Shetty and Mohammad Isam. This is Deivarayan Muthu signing off on the behalf of Karthik Krishnaswamy and Thilak Ram.<br><br>\n\n<b>Mayank Agarwal speaks to <i>Star Sports</i></b>: \"I think the way we're playing at that intensity and the kind of cricket we're playing makes me proud. It can't be easy to break into an Indian team. Mediocre performances aren't enough and you've to push hard for your place in the team. And if you have to replace somebody in the team… you need match-winning performances. The mindset is something I've carried from domestic cricket. It's the same template: get in and make it count. After I got out for 70 in Australia, Ravi Sir said: it's not on. Openers have the chance to make it big. We all know the crowds in India are loud and noisy and playing at Eden Gardens for us and winning games…there's nothing like it. As the day progresses and dew comes, ball comes onto the bat and strokemaking gets easier.  The challenge comes as clearly as you can see in the first session. The conversations with Rohit are quite simple and we make sure we have fun in the field. Not many get the best seat in the house for Rohit. If you're with him, you're on for a show if he bats long. The culture is simple in this team. We all work hard and we look at small areas where we want to improve. In the last session on day two, Bangladesh got about 70 runs in one hour. The captain wants us to be the best side and each player here wants to be the No.1 player.\"<br><br>\n\n<b>2.10pm</b> Time for the post-match presentation. Big cheers for local boy and BCCI chief Sourav Ganguly.<br><br>\n\nIshant Sharma is the Man of the Match in India's first-ever pink-ball Test. Ishant also scoops the Man-of-the-Series award.<br><br>\n\n<b>Ishant Sharma</b>: Shami told me that what you're carrying in your pocket, give it to me (laughs). We just <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/28092541/ishant-sharma-unveils-new-weapon\" target=\"_blank\">developed</a> the last game. Me and bowling coach discussed. It wasn't a fluke and we developed it deliberately. Pink ball is a little difficult, it didn't swing at the start and we need to adjust to the conditions.<br><br>\n\n<b>Virat Kohli, India captain</b>: Amazing, the numbers have only gotten better. We didn't think so many people will turn up today as we know the game will end earlier. This crowd sets the right kind of example. To reiterate the point of Test centres, this is a great example. It's similar to when we play in other countries: it's about the belief. The way these guys are bowling they can pick wickets anywhere. Even the spinners, it's about believing they can pick wickets overseas. We're in the right frame of mind to capitalise on the opportunities and we're enjoying it. The idea is to establish yourself in the middle. Test cricket is a mental battle. We've learnt to stand up - it all started from Dada's team. The belief is key and to be honest we've worked hard, and reaping the rewards of it. I was thinking if they want to announce me as the Man of the Match, it has to go to either Umesh or Ishant. Nine wickets in a Test in India…<br><br>\n\n\n<b>Mominul Haque, Bangladesh captain</b>: \"Definitely, the gap between the two teams is concerning. We've to learn from these two matches and follow up what happened. The pink ball new balls are challenging and we couldn't take the challenge with the new ball. If we lose no problem, but there was some positives. Ebadat bowled well. Riyad <i>bhai</i> and Mushfiqur <i>bhai</i> batted well. When we saw the wickets, when we bat second same thing can happen. Batting second might not have made a big difference.\"<br><br>\n\n<b>Ravi Shastri</b>, India head coach: \"We're bowling as a unit, seeing men bowling at such a professional manner. They've played a lot of cricket in the last 15 months in foreign territory and that's how they learn. The discipline and the hunger to win…they know they're arguably the best side in the world. They've been that for some time and they know there's no short cut. Individuals will not win it and they know it. When you have a crowd like this, they were charged up. They [Bangladesh] need exposure, they're very strong in their country but need to learn when they travel. The more the exposure, the better they'll get. They need more strength in their pace attack overseas. If they have that, they can compete better.\"<br><br>\n\nGood time to also revisit <a href=\"http://www.thecricketmonthly.com/story/1206433/-i-cannot-tell-a-bowler-what-to-do-or-not-do--i-need-to-help-them-understand-their-own-rhythm\" target=\"_blank\">Karthik Krishnaswamy's interview </a>with India bowling coach B Arun<br><br>\n\n<b>B Arun</b>, India bowling coach: \"They do hunt as a pack and they do take pride in others' performances and that's the real secret behind the pack. That's what has given them all the success. We're an experienced bowling attack and the beauty of the attack is how quickly they adapt to situations. I thought they adapted well to pink ball. New Zealand will be a good challenge and we're looking forward to it.\"<br><br>\n\n\n<b>Wriddhiman Saha</b>: \"We have such a good pace attack, all 140-plus. They're successful away from home and at home too. The ball was wobbling quite a bit under lights, swinging too. Bumrah is probably the most challenging to keep to, and after that Shami, Umesh, Ishant.\"<br><br>\n\n<b>1.48pm</b> An innings and 46 runs. It's India's seventh straight Test win, their best-ever winning streak. The fast bowlers have taken all 20 wickets here.
