The celebrations continue as Kohli takes a few more photos. R Ashwin is hugging his two children. The fast-bowling trio of Shami, Ishant and Bumrah pose for a photo as well. \n\n<b>2.55pm</b> The great Allan Border finally hands Virat Kohli the trophy, and the first thing he does is kiss the orb at the top. The rest of his team joins in and he hands Mayank Agarwal, the team's newest member, the trophy. They pose together before Mayank raises the trophy above his head. The crowd roars and there's smiles all around at the SCG. Kohli does another little jig, as Sunil Gavaskar says on TV: \"<i>I have tears in my eyes</i>\". Don't forget, half the trophy is named after him. \n\n\n\n<b>2.41pm</b> <strong>Time for the presentation,</strong> where Isa Guha leads the coverage. A huge roar from the crowd when she announces India as series winners.\n\n<b>Virat Kohli, the winning captain</b> is next to make his way up. He's congratulated by Allan Border before having a chat. He says: \"Firstly, I want to say I've never been more proud of being part of a team, than this one right here. The culture we've built... our transition began right here, where I took over as captain, and I can't believe that after four years we've won here. Just one word to say, 'proud', to lead this team and it's an honour and privilege. The boys make the captain look good. By far, this is my biggest achievement. It's at the top of the pile. When we won the 2011 World Cup, I was the youngest member of the side. Saw everyone emotional there, but I didn't feel it. Here, after coming three times, this win means something else. The series win will give us a different identity, and what we've been able to achieve... something to be proud of. We spoke about our batting as a team, wanted to do the basics. The old, hard grind. Special mention to Pujara, he's been outstanding in the series, especially after his last time out in Australia. He's one guy willing to accept things, he works on his game, he's the nicest man around, and we feel happy for him. Special mention to Mayank Agarwal too, he stood up as a champion on Boxing Day. Speaks highly of his mindset, but as a batting group we all contributed. It's something that augurs well with the team. The way the bowlers have dictated and dominated, not here but also in England and SA, it's something I haven't seen before. Hats off to them, the way they've prepared, their fitness levels, and their mindset. They discuss how to take wickets, and then they dictate their plans to me. It's a revelation in Indian cricket, and something for the bowlers at home to learn. These guys will be looked up to for a long, long time, and they deserve to break the record of the great West Indian fast bowlers. This is just a stepping stone for us. The average age is quite low, but most importantly we had the belief: we had that in SA and in England, and when you're working in the right direction then God knows you're honest. We want to do the best for Indian cricket, and this is outstanding, but it's just a stepping stone. Australia are always going to be competitive. Every team goes through a transition, and their dominance kept world cricket exciting for so many years. I'm sure they'll regroup as a side and play some exciting cricket in the future. We all deserve to enjoy. The celebrations, I assure you, will run long. The boys are physically and mentally drained, and we have no more alarm clocks in the morning. And I want to mention about the crowd as well. They've been outstanding. They never let us feel we're playing away from home. And they deserve this feeling as much as we do.\" \n\n<b>Tim Paine, the losing captain</b> walks up next. He says: \"Have to tip our hat to India, we know how tough it is to win in India so congrats to Virat and Ravi because it's a huge achievement. Disappointed, definitely over the last two Tests. We had our chances in Adelaide, in Perth I thought we played some good cricket, but in Melbourne and Sydney, we've been outplayed. There's been some positives: some talent in this team, and it was good for our top six to play against potentially the world's best bowling line-up. We have Tests against Sri Lanka and then the Ashes, so this series was important. The message to everyone in domestic cricket is to keep scoring runs. We know there are guys outside of this group who want to come in. No illusions, we need to keep working hard. Cricket's a funny game and it can turn very quickly. I'll go home for a couple of days, and most of the guys will be going to the Big Bash for a bit. And then, we'll have an eye on for the series against Sri Lanka.\"\n\n<b>Cheteshwar Pujara is the Player of the Series</b> for his 521 runs at an average of 74. Three tons for him. He receives two trophies. Isa Guha says, \"a special mention to Jasprit Bumrah.\" \n\n\"It's a great feeling for all of us,\" <strong>says Pujara.</strong> \"We've been working hard to win a series overseas, and winning in Australia has never been easy. And really pleased with my contribution. For me, the first hundred was special. Scoring a ton at Adelaide and going 1-0 up is what we were aiming for. As a batsman, I was just getting used to the pace and bounce, and apart from that, playing in South Africa and England has helped me improve my technique. For me, it's all about preparation and I was very well prepared. This is the best Indian side I have been part of. And I would also like to congratulate all our bowlers. We've had four bowlers, and it's not easy taking 20 wickets, so credit goes to all our fast bowlers and spinners..remarkable. I'll be playing some first-class cricket back home, and I'll play some county cricket during the IPL. But the next Test series is some 6-7 months away, it'll give me some time to prepare. I would like to play white-ball cricket, but Test cricket is my priority, and it always be so.\" \n\nRavi Kiran K Pe: \"This win makes me feel prouder than the 2011 worldcup for the only reason of beating Australia in their own backyard. Its something special and going to be retained quite a while.\"\n\nTajender: \"Monday Blues. Most of us are either in office /college / school. Missing the historic moment the we all were dreaming all these years. Congrats team India and thanKs cricinfo for bringing the live update.\"\n\nPrasanna S: \"What a remarkable turnaround of fortunes for Pujara. Not even part of the starting eleven in England and he scripted India's history here. Proves time and again Form is Temporary, Class is Permanent.\"\n\n<b>2.36pm</b> The celebrations continue as Sudhir Kr Chaudhary, the tricolour-clad superfan, waves the Indian flag in the stands. The Indian team applauds the fans who turned up today. A much sombre mood in the Australian camp: they're hanging about near the ground. \n\nHarshad Sardesh: \"For our generation of fans, MSK Prasad opening the innings in Australia encapsulated everything... Guess life has come a full circle, he is the chairman of selectors when we win in australia!\"\n\nSomething from our friends at ESPN.in: In the world of football, India had not won a single match at the AFC Asian Cup since 1964.

After 72 years, India have beaten Australia down under. This game is officially drawn, but for what it's worth, the series winners dominated this Test as well. The presentation will happen super soon. Stay locked. You don't want to miss this. Live pictures show the Indians hugging it out in the dugout. Ishant, Rahane, Hardik, Pant... all of them jubilant. Pujara, like always, smiles in the background. Kohli finally walks out and leads the team handshakes. He meets Paine, and the rest of the Australians. Kohli and Kuldeep do a little jig as well, before the captain asks all his team-mates to join in. Fortnite fans, anyone? \n\nPrashant Chawla: \"As a person who is in an open relationship with cricket from last 20 years(when I was 6), this is an emotional moment which I will never ever forget. Congratulations to Team India and all the fans.\"\n\nLakshitha: \"As a Sri Lankan fan, I would like to congratulate India for this historical series victory, and also to thank them for increasing the probability of a first Sri Lankan test victory on Aussie soil in the on coming series by demoralising the Aussie team. :-)\"\n\nDrew: \"It's probably been said already, but the difference between India winning the series and Australia winning the series was about 30 runs. What a difference two players can make...\"\n\nRushad \"Anyone else's ears ringing with Chak De India right now? So proud of the country and this major achievement! \"\n\nVinay: \"In my lifetime, there is the worldcup 2011 win and then this. nothing comes close (not even the T20 WC win) to these 2 pinnacles of Indian Cricketing success.... \"\n\nVishal: \"My late grandpa would've been 95 today and jumping up and down right now. God I miss him today, more than ever! \"\n\nMuhammad Abbas : \"Thank God rain arrived just a wee bit late and Indians manage to make Aussies bat again and become just a 2nd team in 31 years to do so and will always remain in record books as kohli was the captain... a fan of kohli from Pakistan...\"\n\nSUdha PRITam: \"CONGATULATIONS!!!!!!!!

Don't pick guys who are averaging in the 20's or low thirties because you think they might get better in the future. Just pick the best 6 first class batsmen in the country. I don't care if they're 18, 25 or 33. If young guys are showing potential, that's great, when they get to the top 6 in the country pick them.\"\n\nTomek Holland : \"Absolutely loving the push in the public to ditch Tim Paine, who along with Cummins, Khawaja & Lyon has been of the few who has done the job and looked competent. Blooding Carey as a bat could be a great way to ease him in to Test cricket, cannot be any worse than current middle order, but Paine has done nothing wrong. If only someone would pick some decent selectors.\"\n\nWilson: \"It's a shame Bumrah will be stranded on 49 test wickets for at least 6 months now..!\"\n\nGav: \"@Peter R If you go back to 2001, when Australia was dominating and you expected them to win every match, they werent beating chumps.

See you tomorrow, with an early start.\n\nSo, just to summarise the current situation. Australia are 316 behind, with all their ten wickets in hand. Play will start 30 minutes early tomorrow which is <b>10am local</b>, <b>4.30am IST</b> or <b>11pm GMT</b> (the day before). Only 25.2 overs bowled today, four of them in Australia's second innings. India manged to wrap up Australia's first innings for 300 and enforced the follow-on, becoming the <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/25695352/australia-follow-home-first-31-years\" target=\"_blank\">first team to do so</a> in Australia in 31 years. But then bad light and subsequent drizzle halted play again and forced early stumps.\n\nKashyap: \"Revision of follow on after first day's washout is quite interesting and something I have never heard of. What happens if the play is washed out for the first two days, three days and so on until the fourth day?\" -- 150 for a three or four-day game, 100 for a two-day game and 75 for a one-day game.\n\nDwarak Nath Bak: \"To add to the Hemant's answer to Arvind, five days is from the start of the play. In case first day is washed out, it is considered a 4 day game and follow on difference is 150 in that case\" -- Perfect.\n\nElsewhere, Pardeep Narwal and Pawan Kumar Sehrawat star in ESPN's Pro Kabaddi League Team of the Tournament. <a href=\"http://www.espn.in/kabaddi/story/_/id/25695022/pro-kabaddi-league-2018-pawan-kumar-sehrawat-pardeep-narwal-lead-pkl-6-team-tournament\" target=\"_blank\">Read more here</a>.\n\nShreeyan: \"@ Afnan.. New Zealand domestic team had done this in 2018 that they both declared their first innings..@Hemant am i right??\" -- You are partially right.

The covers are coming on.</b>\"\n\nArvind : \"How do they calculate follow on targets?\" -- Just subtract 199 from the first team's total, that's your target to avoid follow-on. That's for a five-day game.\n\nJohn: \"If Australia are saved by the weather here, 2-1 is a very flattering score line for them.\"\n\n<b>5.15pm \"Umpire are coming out for another inspection,\" says Monga.</b>\n\nAfnan: \"I always wanted to ask this question. Is it possible for a team batting second in the first inning to declare when they know they cannot win or draw the match? What are the rules of declaration for first three innings? Could have Australia declared when they were nine down and forced India bat for a second time?\" -- Australia could have declared but since they were behind the follow-on target, India held the right to ask them bat again.\n\n<b>5.00pm</b> There is still one hour before play can be called off officially. Still some hope.\n\nMany of you want David Warner and Steven Smith back in this Australia side, but for now they are battling against each other in the Bangladesh Premier League. Smith has <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8653/game/1169381/comilla-victorians-vs-sylhet-sixers-3rd-match-bangladesh-premier-league-2018-19\" target=\"_blank\">won the toss and Comilla Victorians will bowl</a>. Warner is captaining Sylhet Sixers.\n\nWhile we wait for play to resume, I am reminded of <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/567750.html\" target=\"_blank\">various reasons</a> which have brought a halt. \n\n<b>5.00pm</b> \"Lots of fans leaving now,\" says Melinda.\n\n<b>4.40 pm</b> It's been 37 minutes since they were promised some cricket and clearly the fans at the SCG aren't impressed. They've turned on the lights on their phones now and beaming it out into the middle. #YoureWelcome<br><br>\n\nThiaga: \"Knowing the light situation and how picky the umps were with it yesterday, if I was Kohli, I would have brought the spinners on very quickly (or even started the innings with them). I think Kohli missed a tactical trick there. India could have possibly bowled another 20 over with just the spinners on.\" Yep. It wasn't like there wasn't any evidence of Australia showing they can bat against spin, like their last-wicket partnership putting on 42 runs, batting for an hour or so, when Jadeja and Kuldeep bowled. India had a new ball. They had Bumrah and Shami who are among the top three wicket-takers in the series. It was a straightforward call.<br><br>  \n\nRicky Ponting hasn't pulled any punches as a pundit over this series. Earlier, while dealing with criticism about the flat pitches over the last two Tests, he said, well then score some runs. Today, seeing Nathan Lyon not take a review - when there were two of them left and with Australia nine down at that point - he said <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/25694807/ricky-ponting-slams-australia-showing-no-desperation\" target=\"_blank\">slack, no desperation</a><br><br>\n\nJacq: \"Everyone keeps harping about Smith and Warner, bit please think why they are out in the first place. They weren't getting results even in helpful conditions with best pace attack. That called for the desperate measure they took and now they are out. Please don't take credit away from the wonderful cricket that India have been playing \"<bR><br>\n\nAniket Jain: \"This has been a tremendously successful series for India. Opener in form of Mayank Agarwal, Che Pu striking gold, Pant excelling with bat and bowlers coming good yet again. Not often you see Indian batsmen as top 3 run scorers in an overseas tour and with Kohli being number 3!\"<br><br>\n\nSaiprasad shett: \"After this test series India are not playing much test until the World Cup, but talking about openers, I feel India have found Mayank Agarwal finally, but who will be the other pair KL or Vijay or will Dhawan should be given a chance, and what will happen ones Prithvi shaw will get fit, but Mayank should be the permanent for now, as he attacks and plays in one end it will be easy for vijay kind of player to handle the new ball.\"<br><br>\n\nSekhar: \"I feel that once we have Prithwi Shaw back, he and Mayank will forge a lethal combination. Both bat without restraint and keeps the scoreboard moving at a frenetic pace. Should be the dawn of a new era for test openers in India\" Sure. No pressure.<br><br>\n\nAnthony : \"Everyone keeps going on about smith and Warner. Australia need Bancroft opening NOW. At least he will hang around and keep his wicket longer than 20 overs. Get him ready for England by playing him in the Sri Lanka tests\"<br><br>\n\nRanger: \"Anthony, Bancroft scored three 50s in 8 tests, averaged 30. Not sure why he'd be an immediate pick NOW, with no first class experience fr 9 months.\"<br><br>\n\n<b>4.20 pm</b> The complications of bad light rages on. \"Big conversation then with Shastri, Kohli and the umps,\" says Mel Farrell from the ground. For the record, we have 31 more overs scheduled to play - and the forecast is expected to be pretty much the same for tomorrow as well<br><br>\n\nRohan Agarwal: \"The absence of Smith & Warner will be a blessing in disguise for Australia. Some of their players will have matured before time which will make them stronger once the two spearheads return. Cricket Australia will also take steps to rebuild the domestic level. I think we will see he rise again in a years time.\"<br><br>\n\nNeali: \"It's not that the Aussie team have bad players. They are all excellent players but a) India have played exceptionally well and b) Australian players have no confidence and who can blame them?...The selectors kept giving Mitch Marsh chance after chance.

That blow that Harris took, ducking straight into the line of a short ball may have made the umpires believe the light isn't good enough for the batsmen to see the ball. They went up to Kohli, had a chat with him and then took the players off. <b>The game will resume at 4.03 pm</b>, according to a tweet from the BCCI handle.<br><br>\n\nAn entire session's been washed off. Australia's tail wagged (a bit). Kuldeep Yadav picked up a five-for in his first Test down under. India enforced the follow on - only the second time they've done that to Australia in Australia.

Kohli takes the trophy and does another photo session with the team. Now the support staff join in as well, with physio Patrick Farhart sticking his head out from behind. Virat's wife, actress and producer Anushka Sharma, also comes into the field. Happy faces everywhere! Jadeja can't stop jumping on the podium. The celebrations continue as Kohli takes a few more photos. R Ashwin is hugging his two children. The fast-bowling trio of Shami, Ishant and Bumrah pose for a photo as well. \n\n<b>2.55pm</b> The great Allan Border finally hands Virat Kohli the trophy, and the first thing he does is kiss the orb at the top. The rest of his team joins in and he hands Mayank Agarwal, the team's newest member, the trophy. They pose together before Mayank raises the trophy above his head. The crowd roars and there's smiles all around at the SCG. Kohli does another little jig, as Sunil Gavaskar says on TV: \"<i>I have tears in my eyes</i>\". Don't forget, half the trophy is named after him. \n\n\n\n<b>2.41pm</b> <strong>Time for the presentation,</strong> where Isa Guha leads the coverage. A huge roar from the crowd when she announces India as series winners.\n\n<b>Virat Kohli, the winning captain</b> is next to make his way up. He's congratulated by Allan Border before having a chat. He says: \"Firstly, I want to say I've never been more proud of being part of a team, than this one right here. The culture we've built... our transition began right here, where I took over as captain, and I can't believe that after four years we've won here. Just one word to say, 'proud', to lead this team and it's an honour and privilege. The boys make the captain look good. By far, this is my biggest achievement. It's at the top of the pile. When we won the 2011 World Cup, I was the youngest member of the side. Saw everyone emotional there, but I didn't feel it. Here, after coming three times, this win means something else. The series win will give us a different identity, and what we've been able to achieve... something to be proud of. We spoke about our batting as a team, wanted to do the basics. The old, hard grind. Special mention to Pujara, he's been outstanding in the series, especially after his last time out in Australia. He's one guy willing to accept things, he works on his game, he's the nicest man around, and we feel happy for him. Special mention to Mayank Agarwal too, he stood up as a champion on Boxing Day. Speaks highly of his mindset, but as a batting group we all contributed. It's something that augurs well with the team. The way the bowlers have dictated and dominated, not here but also in England and SA, it's something I haven't seen before. Hats off to them, the way they've prepared, their fitness levels, and their mindset. They discuss how to take wickets, and then they dictate their plans to me. It's a revelation in Indian cricket, and something for the bowlers at home to learn. These guys will be looked up to for a long, long time, and they deserve to break the record of the great West Indian fast bowlers. This is just a stepping stone for us. The average age is quite low, but most importantly we had the belief: we had that in SA and in England, and when you're working in the right direction then God knows you're honest. We want to do the best for Indian cricket, and this is outstanding, but it's just a stepping stone. Australia are always going to be competitive. Every team goes through a transition, and their dominance kept world cricket exciting for so many years. I'm sure they'll regroup as a side and play some exciting cricket in the future. We all deserve to enjoy. The celebrations, I assure you, will run long. The boys are physically and mentally drained, and we have no more alarm clocks in the morning. And I want to mention about the crowd as well. They've been outstanding. They never let us feel we're playing away from home. And they deserve this feeling as much as we do.\" \n\n<b>Tim Paine, the losing captain</b> walks up next. He says: \"Have to tip our hat to India, we know how tough it is to win in India so congrats to Virat and Ravi because it's a huge achievement. Disappointed, definitely over the last two Tests. We had our chances in Adelaide, in Perth I thought we played some good cricket, but in Melbourne and Sydney, we've been outplayed. There's been some positives: some talent in this team, and it was good for our top six to play against potentially the world's best bowling line-up. We have Tests against Sri Lanka and then the Ashes, so this series was important. The message to everyone in domestic cricket is to keep scoring runs. We know there are guys outside of this group who want to come in. No illusions, we need to keep working hard. Cricket's a funny game and it can turn very quickly. I'll go home for a couple of days, and most of the guys will be going to the Big Bash for a bit. And then, we'll have an eye on for the series against Sri Lanka.\"\n\n<b>Cheteshwar Pujara is the Player of the Series</b> for his 521 runs at an average of 74. Three tons for him. He receives two trophies. Isa Guha says, \"a special mention to Jasprit Bumrah.\" \n\n\"It's a great feeling for all of us,\" <strong>says Pujara.</strong> \"We've been working hard to win a series overseas, and winning in Australia has never been easy. And really pleased with my contribution. For me, the first hundred was special. Scoring a ton at Adelaide and going 1-0 up is what we were aiming for. As a batsman, I was just getting used to the pace and bounce, and apart from that, playing in South Africa and England has helped me improve my technique. For me, it's all about preparation and I was very well prepared. This is the best Indian side I have been part of. And I would also like to congratulate all our bowlers. We've had four bowlers, and it's not easy taking 20 wickets, so credit goes to all our fast bowlers and spinners..remarkable. I'll be playing some first-class cricket back home, and I'll play some county cricket during the IPL. But the next Test series is some 6-7 months away, it'll give me some time to prepare. I would like to play white-ball cricket, but Test cricket is my priority, and it always be so.\" \n\nRavi Kiran K Pe: \"This win makes me feel prouder than the 2011 worldcup for the only reason of beating Australia in their own backyard. Its something special and going to be retained quite a while.\"\n\nTajender: \"Monday Blues. Most of us are either in office /college / school.

It should be called refreshment or something like that. Btw what goes into the Menu of lunch for players? Its strict sporty diet?\" -- Well, we *do* know the Englishmen started this game. What other beverage would they name the session break after, eh? By the way, here's a piece of nugget for you: in the early days of Test cricket, players would drink tea right on the ground!

That said an impressive series win for India in Australia but to talk of passing the baton is perhaps a bit too soon...\"\n\nAbhi: \"@Umair Agree with your point but a couple of clarifications - The scoreline on Ind vs Eng is a bit flattering towards England- it wasn't a hiding... And India can reasonably claim to be the best team in the world as every team seems to be struggling away from home and India has performed in every country\"\n\nDivy : \"By 1995 Windies had ceased to be a cricketing power and only held the crown, the passing of baton term came later on. Australia were a very good team which had competition from SA, Pak and WI in that era for the top spot. By 1999 they secured it by embarking on a 16 test winning spree and continued to dominate for the next 8 years. So right now we are in a more equal era, where India, England, SA are doing well, but with Aus, NZ not far behind. I actually enjoy it this way.\"\n\nSagar Uprety: \"I think the Baton passing happened in 2008 when Graeme Smith's South Africa defeated Australia 2-1 including that famous 414 chase.
