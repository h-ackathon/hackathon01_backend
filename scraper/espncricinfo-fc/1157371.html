</span> sharp turn again from length, Fakhar plays down the wrong line. Was he expecting the googly? Lunged for it and played way outside. Enough gap for the ball to sneak in to hit him just below the knee roll. There wasn't much bounce so height was never going to be in question. Ball tracking confirms this would've gone on to smash into leg. Australia have a big breakthrough at the stroke of tea. What a disappointment, Fakhar falls short of a maiden century. But he's played wonderfully well. Rare lapse in concentration with the tea interval imminent. Labuschagne's legend as a partnership breaker takes another small step. <span class="text-bold"> 204/6 </span></div></div></div><div class="flex-row" data-reactid="208"><div class="wrap batsmen" data-reactid="209"><div class="cell batsmen" data-reactid="210"><a name="&amp;lpos=cricket:game:scorecard:player" href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/41434.html" title="View the player profile of Mohammad Hafeez" data-reactid="211">Mohammad Hafeez</a></div><div class="cell commentary" data-reactid="212"><a class="icon-font-before collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#commentary-002-0" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="commentary-002">c Labuschagne b Starc</a></div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="213">4</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="214">10</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="215">1</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="216">0</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="217">40.00</div><div class="cell highlight active" data-reactid="218"></div></div><div id="commentary-002-0" class="commentary-content collapse" data-reactid="219"><div class="content" data-reactid="220"><span class="text-bold"> 2.6 </span> <strong>Caught at short leg!

Even before the catch was taken, Paine was pretty sure there was a thin edge. Snicko says there was clearly a spike and so <strong>Australia have three wickets in four balls. </strong> Excellent decision to go for the review.

Abbas on fire! <span class="text-bold"> 78/4 </span></div></div></div><div class="flex-row" data-reactid="962"><div class="wrap batsmen" data-reactid="963"><div class="cell batsmen" data-reactid="964"><a name="&amp;lpos=cricket:game:scorecard:player" href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/6683.html" title="View the player profile of Shaun Marsh" data-reactid="965">SE Marsh</a></div><div class="cell commentary" data-reactid="966"><a class="icon-font-before collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#commentary-002-3" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="commentary-002"> b Mir Hamza</a></div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="967">4</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="968">6</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="969">1</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="970">0</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="971">66.66</div><div class="cell highlight active" data-reactid="972"></div></div><div id="commentary-002-3" class="commentary-content collapse" data-reactid="973"><div class="content" data-reactid="974"><span class="text-bold"> 1.3 </span> <strong>bowled him!

Pakistan celebrate with the trophy and they thoroughly deserve it. They outplayed Australia in all facets. Mohammad Abbas was outstanding. Look out for Osman Samiuddin's analysis from the happy Pakistan camp. Daniel Brettig will take a look at what went wrong for Australia and where they head from here. On behalf of Shashank Kishore and Sreshth Shah, and our entire scoring and stats team, thanks for your company. Hope you can join us for the T20 series which begins on October 24 in Abu Dhabi. Until then, goodbye. \n\n<strong>2.06pm Presentation</strong> Man of the match goes to Mohammad Abbas for his 10-wicket haul. He also wins the Man of the series award. What a series he had. He richly deserves it.\n\n<b>Australia captain Tim Paine</b>: \"Obviously really disappointing to have them 5 for 57 on day one and we let that opportunity slip. When you do that against really good teams in Test cricket you pay the price and I thought they batted really well after that in the first innings, put us under pressure and we weren't up to the challenge with the bat.\"\n\n\"I thought our bowlers toiled pretty well on that wicket. To bowl them out twice was not a bad effort. It's just our batting. Mohammad Abbas challenged our defence time and time again and as we've seen a number of times over the last couple of years we've come up short. There's certainly no sugar coating that we've got some real issues with our batting and we need to address it really quickly.\"\n\n<b>Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed</b> has done the interview in Urdu. Shashank Kishore has translated for us: \"The way Abbas has bowled all series is one of the biggest positives for us. I'm feeling fine, just wanted to see if there was concussion.\nFakhar has had an excellent debut, he's an important player. This team management wants to give confidence to young players. All the youngsters who have come through in recent times have done well. We have to groom them all. There was pressure, when the team loses there is pressure, the most important is that the team wins. Thankfully my batting performance in this Test contributed to the win.\"\n\n<strong>2pm</strong> Pakistan were far too good for Australia in this Test and in the series. Incredible to think they were 5 for 57 on day one. But excellent innings from Fakhar and Sarfraz built a good total of 282. Then it was the Mohammad Abbas show. He ripped through Australia in the first innings. Babar Azam played an outstanding knock to make 99 and along with Sarfraz set up the huge fourth innings chase. Australia stood no chance. Abbas again the chief destroyer. \n\nReze : \"What a performance by Abbas. I reckon he will be man of the match and man of the series.\"\n\nSajjad: \"Looking back, Pakistan Would regret not winning this series 2-0. Came so close but Aus kept them away from the whitewash. \"\n\nFiaz: \"This is biggest test win by run before it was 356 against same opposition in 2014 at Abu Dhabi\"\n<hr>\nPakistan celebrate and shake hands with the Australians. Usman Khawaja does not come out to bat due to his knee injury. A supreme performance from Pakistan and particularly Mohammad Abbas. He was simply outstanding, almost unplayable on a surface that wasn't supposed to be conducive to fast bowlers.\n\nMohammad Abbas becomes<a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?bowling_pacespin=1;class=1;filter=advanced;host=27;orderby=wickets;template=results;type=bowling;view=match\" target=\"_blank\"> the first fast bowler to take 10 wickets in a match in the UAE.</a> He would be favourite for man of the series.","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":49.3,"text":"Yasir Shah to Holland, no run, sharp leg break, fizzes from off stump past the edge","event":0,"commId":"449030","commSeq":404903,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":49.2,"text":"Yasir Shah to Holland, no run, looped up on middle and he is forward to defend","event":0,"commId":"449020","commSeq":404902,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":49.1,"text":"Yasir Shah to Holland, no run, leg break, well outside leg, it's full, he defends on the front foot","event":0,"commId":"449010","commSeq":404901,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false}],"overNo":50,"completed":false},{"comments":[{"timeStamp":48.6,"text":"Mohammad Abbas to Holland, 3 runs, runs this with an open blade to third man, nicely done, good length on off, on the front foot he just open the face and run it with control fine of gully","event":3,"commId":"448060","commSeq":404806,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":48.5,"text":"Mohammad Abbas to Holland, no run, short into the ribs, he wanted to duck but it didn't get up, he just fended away to short leg","event":0,"commId":"448050","commSeq":404805,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false}],"overNo":49,"completed":true,"endOfOver":"49 | 6 Runs | AUS: 164/8","endOfOverRunsReq":"","batsmen":[{"name":"Jon Holland","stat":"3 (8b)"},{"name":"Nathan Lyon","stat":"6 (21b)"}],"bowlers":[{"name":"Mohammad Abbas","stat":"17-2-62-5"},{"name":"Yasir Shah","stat":"21-5-45-2"}],"hasLastEndOfOver":true}],"href":"/series/18886/commentary/1157371/australia-vs-pakistan-2nd-test-australia-in-uae-2018-19","enabled":true,"scorer":"Chandan Duorah","commentator":"Alex Malcolm","commentPreText":"","trackingName":"&lpos=cricket:game:scorecard:fullcommentary","groundTime":"","currentOver":49},"scorecard":{"innings":{"1":{"title":"Pakistan 1st Innings","inningStatus":"","isCurrent":false,"batsmen":[{"name":"Fakhar Zaman","displayName":"Fakhar Zaman","href":"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/512191.html","captain":false,"roles":"","trackingName":"&lpos=cricket:game:scorecard:player","hasVideoId":false,"stats":[{"name":"runs","text":"R","value":"94"},{"name":"ballsFaced","text":"B","value":"198"},{"name":"minutes","text":"M","value":"-"},{"name":"fours","text":"4s","value":"8"},{"name":"sixes","text":"6s","value":"1"},{"name":"strikeRate","text":"SR","value":"47.47"}],"isNotOut":false,"commentary":"sharp turn again from length, Fakhar plays down the wrong line.
