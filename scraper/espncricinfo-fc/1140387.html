That's almost a wrap from Sri Lanka, at the end of England's first overseas whitewash since 1963. Thanks for all your involvement, in the Tests and the one-dayers alike. England head home for a rare Christmas break before reconvening in the Caribbean in the New Year.\n\nFidel Fernando's match report is <a href=http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/18602/report/1140387/day/4/sri-lanka-vs-england-3rd-test-eng-in-sl-2018-19 target=_blank>here</A>, and tune in later for all the post-series reaction, stats and videos. From myself, Andrew Miller, and our myriad of commentators and scorers - Alan, Oli, Deiva, Thilak, Raghav et al - thanks and see you next time. And if you haven't got enough of a Test fix for one day, there's still <a href=http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/18879/game/1157382/new-zealand-vs-pakistan-2nd-test-nz-in-uae-2018-19 target=_blank>scenes brewing in Dubai</A>.\n\n\nchathura dharma: \"England won this match by 42 runs and the second test by 57 runs, they have also won the 1st test against India by 31 runs and 4th test by 60 runs, boy they know how to pull off victories when the going gets tough, a hallmark of a great team in the making, watch out Australia for the next Ashes\" It's a fair point. They've found players who can step up in adversity. Though those margins are also a warning that they aren't quite as dominant a side as their recent record of eight Test wins out of nine might suggest.\n\n\n\n\nHere's Root: \"Proud of everyone, a brilliant tour and a real team effort. We knew we were capable but to perform as consistently as we have shows a real learning in the squad.\"\n\n\"A big secret of our success has been being able to pick a team to take 20 wickets and score enough runs on every ground.\"\n\n\"You're only as good as your team, the guys have stepped up, either passing it on to the young guys or coming in themselves. It's been a complete team effort.\"\n\n\n<B>Joe Root</B> picks up a cheque for winning the Test. He'll have a chat in a minute. For the moment, it's <B>Ben Foakes</B> as Man of the Series. \"It's been a crazy few weeks and really good fun. The Sri Lankan guys bowled really well.\"\n\n\"I've been here six times, so knowing the conditions is a big part of it. I'm just going with the flow, here for the ride!\"\n\n\n<B>Suranga Lakmal</B>, speaking in Sinhalese, says he expected a close game, and it was a strong, tough game. It was small things which went wrong, in the future we hope to rectify that. Everybody did their best.\n\n\nTime for some presentations. The Man of the Match is <B>Jonny Bairstow</B>: \"The guys have put in a real shift. It's been an up-and-down tour for me, great to be back part of the lads out in the middle. We look forward to the West Indies now.\"\n\n\"Great to be out with the fans on the boundary,\" he says of not having the keeper's gloves. Remarkably restrained views there, Jonny!\n\n<B>3.46pm</B> Gaurav has been crunching the numbers after a spin-heavy series. The fifth time that spinners have taken 100 wickets in a series, but the first time in a three-match series. <a href=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?bowling_pacespin=2;class=1;filter=advanced;groupby=series;orderby=wickets;template=results;type=bowling target=_blank>And the first time outside of India too</A>\n\nJohn: \"Stokes for MOM for me. he got 99 runs in the match (with 1 fifty) and 4 wickets. Best all round performance.in my opinion\". Fair point. His ten-over spell in the first innings was utterly immense.\n\nShervon: \"Sri Lanka would have sent the batsman from bottom to top rather than top to bottom. \" England know the feeling ...\n\n\n\n<B>3.43pm</B> Richard Bedwell: \"Can I put in a word for Jack Leach as honourable mention for MOS? Plenty of wickets, vital run out today and most importantly bowled with great control. I'd still give to to Foakes though #essexboy\"\n\nAnubhab Mukherj: \"As a die hard England fan since 2005, this series has been a treat to watch. Though SL are not those of old, it still takes lots of skill to whitewash them. This England side is a joy to watch. 2 down-Sl, Sa, 6 to go (Aus, Pak, Nz, Wi, Ind, Ban). Lets get the windies next up.\"\n\n\n\n<B>Ben Stokes: </B>\"It's been tough, really hot. And I am a ridiculously big sweater. The role I played in the team was to be an enforcer and bring a different dimension. We aren't the best at finishing things off, but we can be very proud.\"\n\n\"I'm absolutely knackered,\" says <B>Jack Leach</B>. \"Just trying to get my body going again, as I was keen to get that new ball in my hand.\" On the run-out: \"Love to say I've been working on them. A big moment, I saw it going towards the stumps and thought, that's going to hit...\" He wasn't wrong.\n\n\nDave Fern : \"Thank you Cricinfo for informing, entertaining and keeping us on the edge of our seats throughout this enthralling series. Thoroughly enjoyable.\" A great pleasure, Dave. It's always a pleasure when the cricket is as engaging as it has been! (And even when it isn't, come to think of it...)\n\n\n\n<B>3.34pm</B> Gleeful bouncing from England in the huddle, and handshakes all round. That is a remarkable 100 wickets to spinners, the most in a three-match series, and well, once again, the tea break plays a blinder.\n\nOff come the players, to be greeted by the rest of the squad and the support staff. It has been a true squad effort from England, but huge credit to Sri Lanka, even in defeat. They made England battle hard in all three Tests, and you have to say it was the fielding that made the difference in the final analysis. Not least today.
