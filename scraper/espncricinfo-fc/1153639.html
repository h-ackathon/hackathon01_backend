From the replays it seems like he has. Very well bowled. Drew Taylor forward to defend, and the ball kept coming in with the angle to take a thick inside edge.

The big, big wicket of Williams, that too. Even against Mehidy, he was having a bit of trouble with the one that pitched outside off and turned away, because he wasn't getting his front foot far enough across. He had been worried about the straighter one, worried about lbw, and his front pad had been going away from the line of the ball. Well, now Mahmudullah flights one nicely into that line outside off, and gets it to dip onto a dangerous length and spin away sharply. Williams looks to defend, but he's playing well away from his body and only manages a thick edge, which Mehidy grabs brilliantly with a dive to his left at first slip <span class="text-bold"> 201/5 </span></div></div></div><div class="flex-row" data-reactid="239"><div class="wrap batsmen" data-reactid="240"><div class="cell batsmen" data-reactid="241"><a name="&amp;lpos=cricket:game:scorecard:player" href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/299572.html" title="View the player profile of Sikandar Raza" data-reactid="242">Sikandar Raza</a></div><div class="cell commentary" data-reactid="243"><a class="icon-font-before collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#commentary-005-0" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="commentary-005"> b Nazmul Islam</a></div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="244">19</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="245">52</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="246">2</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="247">0</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="248">36.53</div><div class="cell highlight active" data-reactid="249"></div></div><div id="commentary-005-0" class="commentary-content collapse" data-reactid="250"><div class="content" data-reactid="251"><span class="text-bold"> 47.3 </span> for the first time ever, Test cricket witnesses Nazmul Islam's naagin dance!

Masakadza has played a couple of shots already in this session, and now he's perished! Mehidy came around the wicket, and Masakadza lined him up with a reverse sweep. But he misses completely, and an appeal for lbw is upheld. There's a brief chat between the batsmen about taking the review, but Williams advises against it. Bangladesh break through, and Masakadza falls short of what would have been a second patient fifty in the game. <span class="text-bold"> 101/3 </span></div></div></div><div class="flex-row" data-reactid="712"><div class="wrap batsmen" data-reactid="713"><div class="cell batsmen" data-reactid="714"><a name="&amp;lpos=cricket:game:scorecard:player" href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/427178.html" title="View the player profile of Brian Chari" data-reactid="715">BB Chari</a></div><div class="cell commentary" data-reactid="716"><a class="icon-font-before collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#commentary-002-2" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="commentary-002"> b Mehidy Hasan Miraz</a></div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="717">4</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="718">33</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="719">0</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="720">0</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="721">12.12</div><div class="cell highlight active" data-reactid="722"></div></div><div id="commentary-002-2" class="commentary-content collapse" data-reactid="723"><div class="content" data-reactid="724"><span class="text-bold"> 12.2 </span> <b>lovely bowling</b>.

Liton was aiming to pull to midwicket, but the ball just rushed on to him a little and struck him on the thigh and fairly adjacent. There's no bat involved, the impact is in line and it's hitting the top of middle. Three reds, the opening stand is broken and Zimbabwe celebrate! Excellent referral.

Cheers!\n\nGururaj : \"I am really excited by Brendan Mavuta. He looks a real deal across formats. Hope, he is well preserved by ZC.. \"\n\n\nBengani: \"Roger Federer had still not won a Slam!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, so we asked team ESPNcricinfo about a few quirky facts when Zimbabwe last won an away Test, in 2001. Can you think of a few?\n\n\n<b> Venkat Raghav: </b> \"Cook's entire career played out.\"\n\n\n<b> Vishal Dikshit says: </b> \"Rashid Khan was just three years old then (going by his official age). Mujeeb was just six months old.\"\n\n<b> Osman Samiuddin: </b> \"Afridi was 21. And hadn't retired. Gayle, Rangana Herath, Shoaib Malik and...wait for it... Mashrafe Mortaza are the only current international cricketers who were playing back then. That was Mashrafe's second Test. The two Ws were still playing.\"\n\n<b> Hemant Brar: </b> \"Allan Border held the record for the highest Test aggregate, while Sunil Gavaskar's 34 Test tons were the most.\"\n\n<b> George Binoy: </b> \"Steve Waugh and Carl Hooper were captains of Australia and West Indies\"\n\n<b> Shashank Kishore: </b> \"Kohli was a Delhi Under-15 reject!\"\n\n<B> Saurabh Somani: </b> \"VVS Laxman had scored his 281 a few months back, now he's two weeks away from releasing his autobiography titled '281 and beyond'\"\n\n\n\n<b> Sean Williams is the Player of the Match </b> for two crucial knocks on a tough surface. \"Didn't expect to get this award, got to enjoy this one in the change rooms. It took me a long time to get in on this wickets. Unfortunately I didn't get the 12 I needed for my hundred, but it was good to spend time and score crucial runs. Unfortunately Mavuta didn't get five, but on a spin-friendly wicket, Jarvis and Chatara bowled really well in the first innings.\"\n\n\n<b> Hamilton Masakadza, the victorious Zimbabwe captain: </b> The guys worked hard, applied themselves well to put up an excellent total in the first innings. Ecstatic! The guys took time to stay at the wicket and accumulate runs, something we lacked in the ODIs, myself included. The batting performance in the first innings set it up for us. I thought the bowlers were brilliant right through, since we've landed in Bangladesh. I don't think they've done much wrong. It was great to see our spinners get more out of the surface than Bangladesh's spinners.\"\n\n\n<b> Mahmudullah, the Bangladesh captain: </b> The application wasn't there, we didn't capitalise in the first innings. The wicket was very good, no excuses there. We played too many shots, didn't read the pitch well. Have to learn from our mistakes and bounce back stronger. Taijul was excellent, deserved to finish on the winning side.\n\nBaskar: \"Bangladesh should try and play at more venues other than only Mirpur. They show no promise outside Sher E Bangla, where the next match is gonna happen. It was really laughable that the same team who beat Aus at Mirpur lost pathetically the very next match. A new type of bully they are turning out to be - a one venue bully.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b> This is only Zimbabwe's third away win. </b>\n\n\n<b>1.50pm </b> When Zimbabwe last won an away Test, they still had in their ranks the likes of Andy Flower, Grant Flower and Heath Streak. An entire generation has nearly gone through without savouring an away win, amid growing administrative hassles and political issues. Teams have made them feel unwanted at times, teams haven't toured Zimbabwe because of security concerns at times, a number of their own players have felt letdown by the board, but now is not the time to harp back on the past. \n\nThis is Sikandar Raza's moment, this is Hamilton Mazakadza's moment, as it is for the rest of the side. What an achievement for a young side that was whitewashed 3-0 in the ODIs. Never easy to tackle Bangladesh in a Test in their own conditions, where bigger sides like Australia and England have struggled in recent times. To pull off a win here in Sylhet's inaugural Test is memorable on many counts.","hasVideoId":false}],"overNo":64,"completed":false},{"comments":[{"timeStamp":62.6,"text":"Mavuta to Abu Jayed, no run, huge lbw appeal as he's hit on the pad in trying to prod forward.
