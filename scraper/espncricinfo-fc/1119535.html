An outstanding performance from them with bat, ball and in the field. Only for a couple of hours yesterday evening did England get on top of them. Pakistan emerged this morning with questions over how many they could chase, but the bowlers made sure it didn't matter. Amir and Abbas wrapped up the innings with old and new balls, then the small target has been knocked off before lunch.\n\nPakistan have been brilliant. England have been woeful. Big questions for the them to answer before the second Test at Headingley on Friday. Will the new selector, Ed Smith, make any big calls? We'll stay with you for the presentations shortly. Who will be Man of the Match?\n\nMuddassar: \"Lord's is Pakistan's home ground :)\" They quite like London as a whole!\n\nsagar sk: \"Now after this convincing win, Pakistan need to stay consistent going into the second test without Babar Azam, Who could be the replacement?\"\n\nNaeem: \"and hence Imam ul haq stays unbeatable in 4th innings\" Naveed: \"No push-ups today???\" Not this year!\n\nChris: \"I love Joe and don't want to be too negative, But I'm just not sure he's the right player to lead them. I'd rather be concentrated on his batting at 3 and his conversion rate. Maybe Bairstow could captain and Buttler take the gloves? He's the only other member of the team that could do it really.\"\n\nZaid: \"This performance has made me even more excited about Australia's tour later this year. The battle of the two most complete and, arguably, the two best bowling attacks in the world right now. Starc/Hazlewood/Cummins/Lyon VS Amir/Abbas/Hasan/Yasir! And in the absence of Warner and Smith, the strengths of the batting line-ups match up nicely.\"\n\nPresentation time...<B>Joe Root</b> \"Not good enough. We were out-performed in all three departments. We needed more runs in the first innings. I think we did some really good work leading into the game, making sure we were ready, but we just didn't follow through. We played some poor shots, gave some wickets away. You can't afford to do that. You look at the wicket now and you see how abrasive it is, would have been a different game batting last on that surface. As a batting group we have to find a way. You have to read the game, absorbing a bit a pressure, getting through tricky periods. We have to be a bit smarter. It's a difficult pull to shallow. We have to be better. I'm sure we can bounce back and I'm sure we can do that.\"\n\n<b>Sarfraz Ahmed</b> \"I'm very proud of my team, the way the young players produced their talent. When we came here we were very inexperienced but we were very confident. We have a very good bowling side. Our coaching staff worked really hard, told us to pitch it up. The way the bowlers did a job for us was great. We worked really hard on our fielding. Our catching was fantastic. The Malahide game was a very tough game, the way we won the match it was good for us.\"\n\nMan of the Match is <B>Mohammad Abbas</B> for his match figures of 8 for 64: [Speaking through Wasim Akram has a translator] \"I enjoyed it a lot, Lord's a full house, enjoyed very moment of it. Thank you to PCB for letting me come to Leicester, helped get used to conditions and helped me pitch it up. Glenn McGrath and Mohammad Asif are my heroes, learnt a lot from Asif who has been a great help to me.\"\n\nAnd that just about wraps things up from Lord's.

So enjoy the action there and the rest of your weekend. We'll be back with you on Thursday for the West Indies v World XI T20 at Lord's and then the second Test starts on Friday at Headingley. For now, from Miller and Gnasher, it's goodbye and thanks for joining us.","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":12.3,"text":"Bess to Haris Sohail, no run, gets forward and defends to cover","event":0,"commId":"412030","commSeq":401203,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":12.2,"text":"Bess to Haris Sohail, no run, quicker, flatter, beats the under edge as he goes for the cut","event":0,"commId":"412020","commSeq":401202,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":12.1,"text":"Bess to Haris Sohail, <b>SIX</b> runs, that's a big full and it's launched over the leg side, slog-swept for six into the stands at deep midwicket","event":6,"commId":"412010","commSeq":401201,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false}],"overNo":13,"completed":false},{"comments":[{"timeStamp":11.6,"text":"Wood to Imam-ul-Haq, no run, short of a length outside off, defended on the back foot","event":0,"commId":"411060","commSeq":401106,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":11.5,"text":"Wood to Imam-ul-Haq, no run, a bouncer angled in over off stump, bends down on his knees","event":0,"commId":"411050","commSeq":401105,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false}],"overNo":12,"completed":true,"endOfOver":"12 | 6 Runs | PAK: 56/1","endOfOverRunsReq":"","batsmen":[{"name":"Imam-ul-Haq","stat":"18 (34b)"},{"name":"Haris Sohail","stat":"29 (28b)"}],"bowlers":[{"name":"Mark Wood","stat":"3-1-7-0"},{"name":"Dominic Bess","stat":"3-0-19-0"}],"hasLastEndOfOver":true}],"href":"/series/18025/commentary/1119535/england-vs-pakistan-1st-test-pak-in-ire-eng-scot-2018","enabled":true,"scorer":"@Cricket_Lama","commentator":"Andrew McGlashan","commentPreText":"","trackingName":"&lpos=cricket:game:scorecard:fullcommentary","groundTime":"","currentOver":12},"scorecard":{"innings":{"1":{"title":"England 1st Innings","inningStatus":"","isCurrent":false,"batsmen":[{"name":"AN Cook","displayName":"Sir Alastair Cook","href":"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/11728.html","captain":false,"roles":"","trackingName":"&lpos=cricket:game:scorecard:player","hasVideoId":false,"stats":[{"name":"runs","text":"R","value":"70"},{"name":"ballsFaced","text":"B","value":"148"},{"name":"minutes","text":"M","value":"221"},{"name":"fours","text":"4s","value":"14"},{"name":"sixes","text":"6s","value":"0"},{"name":"strikeRate","text":"SR","value":"47.29"}],"isNotOut":false,"commentary":"oh, that's a beauty - <b>pings the top of off stump and Cook is a goner!</b> Amir celebrates his first wicket, arms spread in the same fashion as when he clinched victory here two years ago.
