World-class from Brendan. We have always known how good he is. Also really impressed with the way Sean Willams played for us throughout the series. Also the seamers, took wickets early, which is never easy in the subcontinent. Losing that second session on the first day's play really put us behind in the game.\"\n\n<strong> The player of the match is Mushfiqur Rahim. </strong> Says: \"It was really badly needed, because the first Test didn't go our way. I think the boys showed some character. Mominul played a gem of an innings. Throughout the series, the bowlers did their part, especially Taijul and Miraz. In Tests at home, we have really dominated at home over the last three years. We are playing Windies next and hopefully we will keep up the good work.(On Miraz) In the last two years, he has been amazing. As a team, hopefully, we will continue to improve.\"\n\n<strong> The player of the series is Taijul Islam. </strong> Says: \"It is always good to perform well, and especially when you do it in your own country. The wicket (in Sylhet) didn't look very helpful at first sight. Today, we were confident of getting early wickets. The Mirpur pitch can be played out for the first one or two overs, and we were confident of getting their wickets. (Miraz) His support has been invaluable.\"\n\n<strong>Mahmudullah, Bangladesh captain</strong>: \"I think the boys were determined enough and showed their character. They stuck to their task. (On the top order) We are working hard and you may not see the results on the pitch yet. With Mushy and Mominul, we built up the partnership, and they gave us some good runs in the first innings. Taijul was brilliant with the ball. I was struggling a bit (myself) and I have to improve to contribute to the team more. (West Indies) will give us a good boost. I'd like to thank the groundsman for this beautiful wicket.\"\n\n<strong>1.43 pm</strong> What a Test match this has been, and so many heroes from the first day to the last. Mominul Haque and Mushfiqur Rahim set up the Bangladesh innings, helping them recover from a precarious 26 for 3 on the first morning, and then allowed them to put pressure on the opposition with scoreboard pressure. Brendan Taylor helping Zimbabwe back into the game with his first-innings hundred, but his team was undone by some superb spin bowling (and catching) from Taijul Islam. Bangladesh had another top-order wobble in the second innings, before Mahmudullah underlined his importance to this team with his first century in eight years. The last day eventually goes Bangladesh's way, but not before Brendan Taylor makes a century in each innings, becoming just the 14th player in all Test cricket to have done it more than once.\nBack soon with the presentation.\n\nMozak: \"Worrying thing for Zimbabwe here should be all of its main top and middle order batsmen are 33+ and there seems to be no young replacement. Will it be the end of Zimbabwe cricket? Hopefully not.\" -- Even more worrying thing is the lack of top-class cricket for them. They don't play another Test until March 2019, when India host them in a one-off game\n\nRod: \"@ Simba I agree, that Chakabva run out was the turning point of the day. Happy for Taylor's century but disappointed he sold Chakabva down a river. Congratulations to Bangladesh\"\n\nShuvo Shafiqur : \"First Test against WI, Bangladesh Lineup: Imrul, Liton be replaced with Tamim & Soumya. Mithun stays. Unfortunately Khaled misses out for Shakib. Provided Tamim and Shakib are fit. \"\n\nMishuk: \"Meraj 64 not out and 3/61 in first innings. Then 27 not out and 5/38 in the second. Definitely a contender for MOTM\"\n\nSeth: \"Bangladesh wins thanks to Mushfiq's magnificent double century. BD won by one fewer runs than Mushfiq scored in his first innings.\"\n\nSimba: \"@Arun, Donald Tirirpano did a very good job as a night watchman and he also picked up a few wickets. The runout of Chakabva has just cost Zim this series win in my view. He could have lasted a good 20 overs with BT. Selection was not so bad in my opinion\"\n\nSaleh: \"this is where you think why in the end they count centuries in winning cause and care less about those in losing cause. What an effort by Taylor, worths more than a defeat (least to say)\" -- To be fair, the aim of all runs and wickets is to help your side win. Perhaps that's why the scores in a winning cause are given greater credence?\n\nFaisal: \"As a Bangladeshi supporter this is first time I prayed for a opponent batsman to score a hundre.
