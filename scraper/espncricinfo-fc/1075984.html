There's a nice thought to sign off on. Good night.\n\n\n\n<B>Faf du Plessis:</B> \"Proper power, Our bowlers in this test match have been amazing. To put the totals on the board in both innings and then bowl them out - Deano and AB have been fantastic.  The nature of how the Tests have gone, there are periods when runs can be scored in the first 30-40 overs, but as soon as you get one wicket you can run through them. But a 50-run lead on that wicket was worth more. There was a good battle between bat and ball, but I'm really chuffed for Morne, it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.\"\n\n\"We are extremely motivated in this series, it was easy for us to tighten the screw on the Australians.\"\n\n<B>The Man of the Man is Morne Morkel</B>: \"I'm a little emotional at the moment, but what an afternoon of cricket.  We asked the guys to give it all. I was hoping I could deliver something special. For me, the best thing was to keep working hard on my fitness and hope to get the opportunity. I got the nod and knew I needed to put my hand up as a senior bowler.\"\n\n<B>Tim Paine: </b> \"it's been a horrible 24 hours and I'd like to take the opportunity to apologise to our fans,\" he says. \"From a cricket perspective, today was extremely disappointing, the way we folded in that last 45 minutes. It's been a real challenge for us, we need to turn ourselves into the cricket team we want to be.\"\n\n\"When you are playing against a side as good as South Africa, it's hard to chase the game. Our bowlers have been okay, but our batters have got plenty of starts but no-one's got a hundred. At the end of the day, we have to regroup and put on a show for our fans, families and public.\"\n\n\n\n<B>5.53pm</B> Gonzo: \"Subdued game? You have high standards when it comes to interest and excitement!\" Well, you know what I mean. The actual cricket was a bit incidental at times in the past two days. Although that final session perked the crowd up no end. 45,000 at Newlands over the four days, incidentally, which is pretty healthy\n\nJohn: \"Perfect match for Morkel, thumbs up to him. Hope he gets a niggle and doesnt come for last test match as I don't see him doing better than this. Not to mention this particular test match will be remembered for a long,long time!!!\" He might not get a niggle, but South Africa might get an Ngidi...\n\n\n\n<B>5.47pm</B> Edwin DSouza: \"Hopefully Morkel will reconsider his retirement from Test cricket on this performance...\" Sadly, it's not going to happen. He's 34 this year, and has been a fine servant for more than a decade. But I'm delighted that he's going out on a personal high. A nice upbeat subplot to an otherwise subdued game.\n\nMark: \"Agree with Andrew's call for discussion, so let's begin: 1. Use of solid objects to deform the ball isn't permitted. Makes sense else bowlers will rub the ball on the ground next. 2. Liquids are ok so long as its saliva, sweat. You can't hold a ball in a bucket of water. I suspect Andrew will find these are indeed current rules. What's more to discuss?\" Well, the practice of bouncing the balls on the practice wickets when returning shies, for one. Seriously, whose business is that other than the fielders themselves?\n\nKofi Nkansah: \"Thank you for posting David's comment, I was in need of a good laugh. I think all the posts today have been made \"within the spirit of the game\" and \"without crossing the line.\" Two excellent bits of Australian terminology.\" Well, we like to headbutt that line here at ESPNcricinfo ...\n\n\n\n\n<B>5.43pm</B> Handshakes and high-fives all round for the South Africa players. They have kept their counsel and their focus in a crazy couple of days, and are now 2-1 up with one to play, and gunning for their first home series win against Australia since readmission...\n\nGraeme: \"I think the thing that stands out about Morkel for me isn't no just his outstanding bowling, but the sportsmanship he's shown, he was genuinely concerned when he hit Starc on the head and came up and made sure he was alright, a fantastic man\" He's been a mighty presence for South Africa, and what a game for him personally. A career-best nine wickets in the match, including his 300th in Tests. Presentations coming up, I think we've found the man of the match.\n\n\ndavid: \"Keep on posting the disgusting bias commentary you have been all day. The Aussies have been and still are by FAR the most sporting cricket team around. Maybe like a few facts about the cheating that has gne on in other countries?\" Just calling it as we see it, David. But keep the faith\n\n\n\nAnd that, as they say, is that. Australia have lost all ten of their wickets for 50 runs in the space of 19.4 overs. And on a grim day for their cricketers, they have also ensured that England no longer boast the most gruesome Test collapse of the week...","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":39.3,"text":"Morkel to Hazlewood, no run, sharp once again, much better line, gallumphing into the splice as Hazlewood hops to defend","event":0,"commId":"439030","commSeq":403903,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":39.2,"text":"Morkel to Hazlewood, 4 byes, short and massively wide of the batsman, and the wicketkeeper!
