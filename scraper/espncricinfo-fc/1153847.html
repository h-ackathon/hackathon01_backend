A very convincing margin for the home side but they had to work for it today. An excellent stand between Soumya Sarkar and Mahmadullah, who both made impressive hundreds. However, once Boult made the breakthrough with the new ball there wasn't much more resistance from the lower order - an area Bangladesh really need to work on. They will regret that first innings collapse from 121 for 1 which just didn't leave them any sort of total to play with on a good batting pitch. New Zealand put them to the sword with their record total of 715.\n\n<b>Player of the Match is Kane Williamson</b> \"As a batting unit on that surface we wanted to bat long, was fortunate to help be a part of a number of partnership.\" Modest, as ever.\n\n\"It feels great to win. We knew it would be big push. The surface wasn't going to offer a huge amount. We knew Bangladesh had a lot of quality. I thought throughout the whole Test the bowlers were outstanding. No seam movement, a little bit of swing and bounce which we tried to extract with the short ball. It was an outstanding opening partnership, Tom is churning them out and for Jeet to make a hundred was so pleasing. It will be a different assignment in Wellington, we'll have to adapt and not rest on this performance. I've no doubt if the game had gone five days we'd have seen more spin.\"\n\n<b>Mahmadullah</b> \"The wicket was really good to bat on and we missed our opportunity. That was the most valuable opportunity, if we could have got a good first innings. It's a learning curve for the bowlers, but they have the courage. We just need to put it in the right areas all the time. They were bowling really good areas but we needed to cope with that but there's no benefit if you are on a losing side.\"\n\nThat just about wraps things up for this Test. The second match starts in Wellington on Friday and we'll be back to bring you coverage of that. For now, from Gnasher, Karthik, Sreshth and Ankur it's goodbye and thanks for joining us.","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":102.5,"text":"Southee to Ebadat Hossain, no run, full and straight, defended into the covers","event":0,"commId":"3102050","commSeq":310205,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":102.4,"text":"Southee to Ebadat Hossain, no run, short outside off, left alone","event":0,"commId":"3102040","commSeq":310204,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"Steve B: \"There must be a spinner in a NZ regional team who wanted to follow in the footsteps of J Bracewell & Vettori.
