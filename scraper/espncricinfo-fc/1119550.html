But Jennings wants the third umpire's seal on this and has called for DRS. Unless he has nicked it, he's going to have to go. And UltraEdge says he hasn't. So Shami gets the reward for pitching the ball up; pitching it up so much that it nearly becomes a yorker. Jennings plays all around it, barely moving his feet, closing the face of the bat, looking for runs through midwicket when he really should have been using a straight bat. Well, he'll have plenty of time to think about his choices in the dressing room. <span class="text-bold"> 28/1 </span></div></div></div><div class="flex-row" data-reactid="468"><div class="wrap batsmen" data-reactid="469"><div class="cell batsmen" data-reactid="470"><a name="&amp;lpos=cricket:game:scorecard:player" href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/303669.html" title="View the player profile of Joe Root" data-reactid="471">JE Root (c)</a></div><div class="cell commentary" data-reactid="472"><a class="icon-font-before collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#commentary-003-1" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="commentary-003">lbw b Mohammed Shami</a></div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="473">19</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="474">53</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="475">82</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="476">2</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="477">0</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="478">35.84</div><div class="cell highlight active" data-reactid="479"></div></div><div id="commentary-003-1" class="commentary-content collapse" data-reactid="480"><div class="content" data-reactid="481"><span class="text-bold"> 24.4 </span> <b>keeps low</b> and he's caught in front!

Sid Monga's report will be up soon, and we have Miller, Naga and Mel lurking at Lord's to give you plenty of analysis, alongside Polite Enquiries. Good night!<br><br>\n\n<b>Chris Woakes:</b> Delighted. I suppose to win the Test match inside four days when you lose a day and half to rain is special. Scoring a hundred and getting on the honour's board is something that'll stay with me a lot. It's sinking in more. I wish I'd soaked it in a little more. But like I said, I was a bit nervous out there yesterday. Jonny calmed me down, which is funny, it's usually the other way around. We just looked to tick it off in fives. Once we got through the tough part, we started scoring freely. [His return from injury] Really pleased with the bowling. Getting competitive cricket was important, even though it was white-ball cricket. \n\nYes it was a fight [getting the ball out of Jimmy's hands]. Once Broady gets his legs pumping, it's brilliant to watch. Well backed up by Sam as well.<bR><bR>\n\n<b>Chris Woakes is the Man of the Match.</b><br><br>\n\n<b>Joe Root:</b> Less stressful [win] definitely. The bowling unit were exceptional throughout. We had the conditions in our favour, but we had to put it in the right places. Jonny and Woakesy were magnificent. Really pleased for Woakesy. A number of times he's showed how talented he is. He's been working hard. Coming back into the side, someone who's always been a big part of the side. Good to see.\n\nUltimately it was about doing the same things again and again. We're in a nice position. I thought he [Pope] played really well. To come in and put pressure on the opposition in a tough batting period was good. We've got another day to rest and recover and get our heads around what we've done this week. We still haven't played our best game. There's room to improve and that's the most exciting part for us.<br><br>\n\n<b>Virat Kohli:</b> Not proud of the way we've played. First time in the last five Tests that we've been outplayed. We deserved to lose this game, the way we went about things. Can't really think about conditions when you're playing the game. You can't sit and crib about these things. Sometimes the rub of the green won't go your way. Even when the ball's doing a bit, you have to pitch it in the right areas. Their guys were relentless, they made us work for the runs. [Extra seamer] Yeah looking back, I thought we got the combination wrong. [About his injury] I should be fine. Lower back issue, I'm confident I'll be fine in five days time with a bit of rehab.<br><br>\n\n<b>Stuart Broad:</b> \"I think it's a powerful performance. Right up there. The emotions at Edgbaston took a lot out of us. Good to come to Lord's and put the same kind of energy. We were fortunate with how the clouds came to work for us. We talked bout it [patience]. We didn't give India too many freebies. We're really enjoying being out there. We [bowling unit] each bowl it a bit differently, that helps. Was gutted when it rained [during his fiery spell]. \n\nSo disappointed with the hat-trick ball, it was so bad! \n\nWe talked a lot about the bowlers maybe having to rotate, but we've not had an innings where someones's got a lot of runs. A few calm days before the next one.\"<bR><br>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/video/clip?id=24357251\" target=\"_blank\"><b> WATCH - It's all over for India!

Even Adil Rashid has grabbed one by the looks of it. Why not! A win by an innings and 159 runs. India have been rolled over with more than an hour left on the fourth day of a Test that didn't have play on the first day. Yes, it's been that bad for them. This Test lasted 170.3 overs. But we have a result. Anderson, Bairstow, Woakes and Broad the wreckers-in-chief as India crumbled across all three innings.
