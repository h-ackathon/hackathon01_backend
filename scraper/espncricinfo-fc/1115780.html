Shifts around the wicket for a big ol bouncer, and it rises up around the left-hander's throat and tries as he might to get inside the line and power it away, the bounce is just a smidge too much for him to properly keep it down. Boult is the man tracking the ball, running forward and to his right. Takes it right in front of his face in a manner that suggest he might not have seen the ball all that well. Chuffed that he's caught it though. <span class="text-bold"> 94/2 </span></div></div></div><div class="flex-row" data-reactid="696"><div class="wrap batsmen" data-reactid="697"><div class="cell batsmen" data-reactid="698"><a name="&amp;lpos=cricket:game:scorecard:player" href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/303669.html" title="View the player profile of Joe Root" data-reactid="699">JE Root (c)</a></div><div class="cell commentary" data-reactid="700"><a class="icon-font-before collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#commentary-003-2" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="commentary-003">c &dagger;Watling b Boult</a></div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="701">51</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="702">131</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="703">191</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="704">5</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="705">0</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="706">38.93</div><div class="cell highlight active" data-reactid="707"></div></div><div id="commentary-003-2" class="commentary-content collapse" data-reactid="708"><div class="content" data-reactid="709"><span class="text-bold"> 46.5 </span> <b>he's gone.

Oh this is such a top spell from Wagner. He's breathed life back into a sullen-looking New Zealand side. Plugs away outside off and Stokes, with three balls to go for the break, has lost his concentration after a long, very good knock. Backs away and looks to swat this bouncer over point. There are two fielders in that region - a backward point and a conventional point. Southee is stationed at the latter and he has free path to get under this after calling for it. Has to really adjust his radar because he's running backwards and looking up at the same time. Follows it with his hands, and grabs on as it sways to his right.

The weather certainly was a excitement factor.\"<br><br>\n\n<b>Williamson:</b> It was a fantastic performance from us. If we go back to that first innings, we bowled great lengths and also got lucky to find the edges. They fought really hard but it was great we were able to fight the pressure and come through. [On the declaration strategy] At the end of the day, you have to execute after making your choice. All our partnerships were slow-going but in the end they added up for this win. We knew we wanted to come out and play the long game. We didn't wanna get ahead of ourselves. We knew we had an old ball. We tried to build pressure and then a couple went our way. It was great to come out in the last session and do it in front of this crowd. Toddy bowled brilliantly, the wicket took a bit of turn. He had to bide his time but with the pink ball you had to measure what it would do. He was patient and when he got his chance he took it. <br><br>\n<b>Root:</b> Yeah we weren't good enough [on day one]. We have to learn some lessons quickly. It's difficult to single any one things out, we didn't deal with the swing and seam very well. I thought the character of the dressing room today were fantastic. I thought today was a great exhibition of the guys determination of playing for the country. Finger's fine and I should be fine to play next game.<br><br>\n\n\n<b>Trent Boult is the Man of the Match</b><br><br>\n\n<b>Wagner:</b> I don't know [how many overs on the trot] but it's a very special feeling. We knew we were going to have to take it deep. Tried to get the game into the night but it wasn't doing too much. The boys stuck it out though. The catching was great - with the amount of training we've been doing under lights catching the pink ball. Lot of variables with the pink ball, but we are accustomed to it. you summon your strength for the team and the country, and I'm happy.<br><br>\n\n<b>7:57pm, Day 5</b> Did you think we would get to this timestamp on Thursday afternoon? Annoying as it might have been, the rain brought dimensions to this game we might not have witnessed otherwise. Some fantastic cricket from England during the final phase of this game  - they batted 126 overs and came really really close. But it was a reality check in the end. You don't get results in your favour if you're bowled out for 58. And you don't get an easy draw when Neil Wagner's running in at you on the final day. Some top efforts from both sides, but this moment belongs to Wagner who got three out of England's four half-centurions.","hasVideoId":false}],"overNo":127,"completed":false},{"comments":[{"timeStamp":125.6,"text":"Wagner to Anderson, 1 run, good length at leg stump, hangs the bat out and gets this down to fine leg off the inside half","event":1,"commId":"3125060","commSeq":312506,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"Anshit Agrawal: \"12th over in a spell for a fast bowler who is running in hard and trying to bowl bouncers half of the them... commendable!!\"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":125.5,"text":"Wagner to Anderson, no run, short of a length at off stump, defended off the back foot","event":0,"commId":"3125050","commSeq":312505,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":125.4,"text":"Wagner to Anderson, no run, short one at off stump, nicely behind this to drop it in front of silly point with soft hands","event":0,"commId":"3125040","commSeq":312504,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":125.3,"text":"Wagner to Anderson, no run, <b>is there glove there?</b> No says the umpire.
