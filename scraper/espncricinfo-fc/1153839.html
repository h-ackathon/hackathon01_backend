Very proud.\"\n\nSayan Dey: \"Wagner denied Boult a 10-for and Boult returned the favor by denying Wagner a 5-for, though neither will really mind!!! Wonder if they ever involve in banter like this over a beer after the match...\"\n\nWilliamson receives the trophy. Pictures and celebrations all around.\n\nThis is the fourth series win for New Zealand in a row. First time ever for they have done it. \"A guy just told me now [about that],\" says <b>Kane Williamson</b>. \"It's one game at a time, one day at a time. After the last Test, we wanted to play a little bit better, to show a fighting quality that Sri Lanka showed in the first Test. A couple of brilliant contributions from those two local boys. After the first session yesterday, there were signs of a deja vu. Unfortunate for Angelo to get injured but that opened up one end for us. But it's exciting, the four series wins on the trot is a proud achievement.\"\n\n\"The way we batted in the first innings in both Test matches was disappointing,\" says Sri Lanka captain <b>Dinesh Chandimal</b>. \"But it was good to see a better performance in the second innings. Suranga did a really good job, overall the seamers have done a decent job.\" On upcoming challenges: \"We have Australia and South Africa coming up. If we can compete with them and win, it'll be good for our confidence.\" On Mathews: \"He's outstanding player, he has got a lot of experience of intentional cricket. When he comes back, it will a great advantage. He showed a lot of character to come back from the injury, but unfortunately got injured yesterday.\"\n\n<b>Tim Southee is the Man of the Match</b>, for his all-round performance. \"Every time you win a Test match, it's a great feeling,\" he says. \"It was obviously nice to get some runs, all the tailenders work hard on their batting. It's going to be a big summer here and it was great to be part of a series win.\"\n\nTime for the presentation.\n\nChris: \"So proud of this New ZealNd team. They seldom put a foot wrong. So professional. A reflection of the captain I guess.\"\n\n<b>11.12am</b> Twelve minutes. That's all it took this morning as New Zealand hand Sri Lanka their largest defeat by victory margin.
