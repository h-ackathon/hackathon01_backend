But Sodhi has reviewed the call. This will be tight. It's a very well flighted delivery, always angling into the right-hander, so much that Sodhi is nearly late on it. And is nearly yorked as well. Replays indicate it might have hit bat first before pad, but we need UltraEdge to confirm. And it does indeed break the deadlock, by inches. The ball grazes Sodhi's boot half a second before it goes up to hit his bat.  'I'm happy that that's pad first,' says the third umpire Reiffel.

What nervy last few moments. But New Zealand have 1-0 lead now, with two Tests to go. For now, that's all from us. Hope you enjoyed our coverage. See you soon, everyone!\n\n<b>Kane Williamson:</b> We knew the surface was not an easy one. There was considerable turn from day one and all the spinners bowled well. A great advertisement for Test cricket. In the end, it came down to the wire. We will sit down and review our performance and the things to improve upon. The attitude, certainly today and throughout the game, was brilliant. How those two bowlers [Ajaz and Wagner] bowled, for almost I think 20 overs, was brilliant. From our perspective, it's important to look at things we could have done better, but at the same, the fighting spirit we should, we would like to hold on to that.\n\n<b>Sarfraz Ahmed</b>: We are really disappointing, we didn't get a good start, but then Azhar and Shafiq put in a good stand but then the collapse was really disappointing. You have to give credit to Ajaz as well. I think the shots batsmen played towards the end were really disappointing. We had an opportunity to win this Test but we will try not to repeat the mistakes we made here.\n\n<b>Ajaz Patel (Man-of-the-Match):</b> My game plan is very simple, even though the scoreboard didn't look single. As a unit, we kept chipping away. A lot of credit goes to the environment we have, a very calm environment we have. In terms of the pressure on debut, I think I have put in a lot of handwork, leaving the rest to Allah. It's an absolute dream come true in the end. We know Pakistan have got very good players of spin, but we kept chipping in there, and in the end, all thanks to Allah.\n\n<b>2.42pm</b> Time for presentation.\n\nPakistan were cruising at 130 for 3 at one stage, that's when Wagner removed Shafiq moments before the lunch break. Then there was a mix-up between Babar Azam and Azhar Ali, resulting in Babar's wicket, and that gave New Zealand a real opening. Ajaz Patel bowled that beautiful line and length, just around off, teasing batsmen with optimum flight. Still, the steely Azhar Ali was there. One can say he should have farmed the strike once Bilal got out. Did he leave it too late? Perhaps, but then he took them within five runs of victory, before Ajaz Patel dealt the final blow.\n\n<b>Ajaz Patel:</b> A dream come true. The plan was to keep it simple and quite, bowl on middle and off, nice and straight. I am 30 now, I have put a lot of work in to put myself here.\n\n<b>2.30pm</b> What a Test match we had. A well-deserved victory for New Zealand, by a narrow margin of four runs. Wagner bowled 13 on the trot, a debut to remember for Ajaz Patel, a five-wicket haul including that final wicket of Azhar Ali.
