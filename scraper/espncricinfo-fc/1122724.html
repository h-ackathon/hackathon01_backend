He tried to lift it over midwicket with the spin, a good option, but because he didn't quite get to the pitch and because that ball slid on with the arm, it took the outside half of the bat and lobbed up.

Thirimanne is already on a middle stump guard and shuffling into the off side, but he still has to reach out. It's that wide. The best he could hope for was to somehow get bat on it. There was no way he could have controlled the shot. Ends up slicing it straight - and very feebly - to backward point.

But do keep a weather eye on the horizon for post-match stories from the ground, and of course, India will be picking the squad for the tour of South Africa <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/21570926/jasprit-bumrah-shardul-thakur-contention-south-africa-tour\" target=\"_blank\">later today</a>. We'll bring you the latest as the story develops. Until then, go on, get outta here.<br><br>\n\n<b>Virat Kohli is the Man of the Match</b>\"The pitch was good to bat on. It was on the slower side, but there was nothing much happening from the pitch. I just wanted to bat the way I bat: get into good position and rotate strike and score quickly so our bowlers have time to bowl the opposition out. We will need that overseas so I was looking at doing that here as well. I always wanted to better myself in that aspect, scoring daddy hundreds, for the simple reason that the team benefits. When you lose concentration after a hundred, maybe two wickets can fall quickly. And a set batsman can play shots easier than a new batsman so I started thinking in that way and my fitness helps me bat for longer periods. Wonderfully well, Pujara we know, he's been very consistent. Vijay was playing after a while, he takes pride in playing Test cricket. I know it hurt him to be out and he came back really well. Rohit as well, making a strong case for himself in the future. He will always be there when we speak about combinations. We have a lot of Test cricket coming up. All the bowlers, Bhuvi has played a lot of cricket for India in the last few months. Ishant, Shami and Umesh, not so much. But they bowled a lot of overs in first-class cricket and they always say that's important for rhythm. And even on this pitch, they were excellent. Although the spinners did a good job for us, Ishant was the standout bowler. We would like to think we want to prepare for South Africa. That's why we asked for pitches with help for hte fast bowler.s This one deteriorated. Kolkata was the ideal wicket. There's not enough time in between to prepare so we have to use the time we have now for a big tour coming up\"<bR><bR>\n\n\"It was a good toss to win. Unfortunately, we were outplayed from the first day of the game. Our batting unit let us down again. You have to score at least 350 plus against India to win or even stay in it for five days,\" <b>Dinesh Chandimal the Sri Lanka captain says</b>. \"Before we came here, we had a gameplan. Then we said to the guys, if you get a start, you have to bat long. But they scored only 50-60 runs and got out. Its unfortunate but I'm sure they will learn. Angelo is the one who is the most senior guy in the line-up. And if he is not scoring, our team goes down. As senior players you need to stand up and perform so the youngsters can follow. I'm sure he will stand up and make it count again. Our body language when we were bowling for three days, it was superb. We need to score more runs in the first innings and that's what we need to do in Delhi. ON this wicket, first three days was good to bat on. First innings total became a big factor. Our bowling unit did a really great job, but if there's no runs on the board, we can't do anything\"<bR><br>\n\n<b>1.15 pm</b> Out stats expert Gaurav Sundararaman chips in with: \"32 wins for India in 2017 - Most they have won in a  year going past the 31 wins they had in 2016. Next target is Australia's record of 38 wins in 2003. 7 more matches to go.\"<br><br>\n\n\"Today was a bit funny in the morning,\" <b>R Ashwin says</b>. \"We started off and the ball spun a little bit, it kept straight as well. Special mention to Ishant, he's bowled really well after coming back. The angular release also makes it difficult, changing the height of the release has also helped. And me and Jaddu bowl the right pace on these kinds of wickets. We are a bit more blessed than the other greats. We have technology to help. We have help with our fitness. So we shouldn't compare. The carrom ball was a good ball, I haven't bowled many of those in the last 24 months. I've worked on different releases for it and now that we are travelling, I think I needed that extra bit. It has been al longer break than I've been used to over the last few years. But I did have a good stint in Worcester and I learnt a lot of things. As you can see, I've worked on different loadings, different actions. It's also helped my patience, wickets haven't come quickly. I really hope I can go on to double these 300 wickets, I've only played 50 Tests. It's not easy bowling spin, it looks like you're just ambling up. But there's a lot behind it. We've bowled a lot of overs, me and Jaddu. And the break has helped, I'm a lot more fresher now comparatively.\"<br><br>\n\nIf that's not enough, you can get a lot more of Ashwin in this comprehensive <a href=\"http://www.thecricketmonthly.com/story/1068145/chennai-super-king\" target=\"_blank\">profile piece</a> for The Cricket Monthly by Karthik Krishnaswamy. For those who cringe at 3000 words of text, here's a <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/video_audio/1126520.html\" target=\"_blank\">snappy little video</a> debating whether Ashwin is already an all-time great<br><br>\n\n\"The way Umesh and Shami have bowled, they deserved to get the chance before me,\" <b>Ishant Sharma says</b> of his time out of the Test side. \"I think at the moment, that's what matters. The wickets column was always empty, so I needed to outthink the batsman. That's what I did here. Thanks to Basu sir, he's pushing everyone hard on fitness and Virat is setting the example. It's a pretty good competition among fast bowlers in India. We have to take wickets whenever we get the chance to perform. We have to be on our toes\"<br><br>\n\n<b>1 pm So India win by an innings and 239 runs</b>, equalling their biggest win in Tests. The biggest factor that brought this result to the fore was Sri Lanka's batting - crumbling for 200 on the day on a batting pitch. India took the advantage there and never gave it away. M Vijay, Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli - three of their top four - made massive centuries. And their lead spinner R Ashwin finishes the Test off with 300 Test wickets, the now the quickest to the mark, on the same day as the previous record was set by Dennis Lillee.<br><br>","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":49.2,"text":"Ashwin to Gamage, no run, tosses it up on middle and off.
