Thank you for your feedback and time, plenty of other Test cricket today, so stay tuned. Bye. \n\n<b>2.29pm</b> Neil Wagner takes nine wickets in the first game of the home summer, leading his side off the field in what has been a clinical display from New Zealand right through this Wellington Test. Wagner sparked this game to life on the first morning with an incisive display of short-ball bowling. \n\nNew Zealand were never going to squander that advantage thereafter, declaring with a first-innings lead of 386. West Indies battled their way through their second innings, showing some fight and resolve on the third day, but they seemed lost today, and eventually crumbled to an innings defeat.\n\n<b>Neil Wagner is the Man of the Match</b>: \"A tough graft, the wicket got better as the Test match went on. we bowled well in partnerships.

We got better as the game went on, some soft dismissals which didn't help our cause.
