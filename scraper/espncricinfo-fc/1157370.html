That is also Australia's last review. A superb innings comes to an end - and it's been done by some smart field placement. They put in a deep-ish gully fielder that took out the reverse sweep. They had short leg and leg gully, so the forward block was dangerous with the ball ripping in from around the wicket. He had to play the sweep - and he missed it.

That's all we have from today. What a superb, superb Test match. We had a great time covering it and we hope you enjoyed our coverage. On behalf of Alex Malcolm and Thilak, this is goodbye from me!<br><br>\n\n\n<b>Sarfraz Ahmed:</b> We hoped to roll them out but we have to give credit to Khawaja. We had an idea that he would understand out tactics but it wasn't easy to bat and despite that he soldiered on, we must give him credit. We need to work hard - in Tests you learn as much as you play. Haris decision was quite close, but this happens. We have little things to work on. We should praise Abbas a lot. The way he bowled on this pitch after returning from County cricket was tremendous. The batsmen who got their opportunities also took them. that's a positive. We could have won this but Tests are like this. We're sad, but the opposition also played well and we need to acknowledge that.<br><br>\n\n<b>Tim Paine:</b> It was extremely tough Test  match. Pakistan played very well and had us under the pump for three days. Proud of our comeback. Everyone had a plan. Usman was more defensive than usual. There was a bit of a collapse but the guys have been working hard over the last few months and I'm happy everything's gone to plan. I was nervous [in the last 45 minutes]. I think that's how it happens here. If batsmen get in, it's easy. Really proud of the way out tail stuck at it. No it doesn't feel like a win. We were outplayed. Proud to get something out of it, but we can play a lot better in the next Test. <br><br>\n\n\n<b>Usman Khawaja:</b> [The plan was to] Just bat. Wasn't thinking too much. It was decent but it was getting tougher and tougher. We thought that if we batted two sessions we'd be in good stead. Very happy and thankful we got away with the draw there. Every time you get a hundred for Australia it's amazing. Doesn't matter if it's here or at home. Just thankful. As a left hander you always have rough to deal with so you need a plan (about reverse sweeping against Yasir). <br><br>\n\n\n<b>Usman Khawaja is the Man of the Match</b>\n\n<hr>\n\nBaskar: \"Tim Paine is my latest inspiration. He's led a broken Aus team to a huge draw today. He came in here with a plethora of questions on him, and he's started his answers in style.\"<br><br>Ryan M: \"Lyon batting 10/11 makes sense when Australia are on top, but he should definitely bat 8 whenever endurance is the name of the game.\"<br><br>Dhaval S: \"This gritty batting display ignites excitement about the upcoming India's tour of Australia down under which was undermined by the absence of key players like Smith, Warner and Hazlewood. It is going to be a revelling contest.\"<br><br>Greg: \"Very proud Aussie supporter... Stuck with them the whole match and always believed they could do it... Could be a turning point for Khawaja and Paine as a captain. Langer's influence already showing\"<br><br>Darryl: \"Following this in Perth WA. So great to have something to cheer about. Well done Paine and Khawaja\"<br><br>Mukesh Bhat: \"Can we unanimously say this is test match of the year?\"<br><br>Awais: \"I almost lost all my nails. What a finish.. \"<br><br>Omar: \"In tense situations like these, this is where the home crowd advantage helps and builds the pressure on the away team. Sadly, Pakistan doesn't have that with empty stands in its home away from home.\"<br><br>Leon Schneider: \"Monumental effort from the Aussies. Surely Nathan Lyon should be batting at number 8. Forget scoring ability - his batting technique is far superior than any of the other bowlers in the Aus team!\"<br><br>Jai Srivastava: \"For me Usman Khwaja should be MOTM.He s scored 226 off 477 balls.\"<br><br>navin: \"When your openers score more than 150 combined in both the innings, you cannot afford to lose the match, but the failure of the middle order would have cost them the match, Well played Aussies, hope to see a much improved performance from the Pak bowlers in the next match. Good to see a draw which has become a rarity nowadays in the Test cricket.\"<br><br>Varahan: \"Huge credit for Lyon for his stay.\"<br><br>\n<b>5:25pm, Stumps, Day 5</b> Handshakes. <b>Australia play their longest fourth innings in Asia</b> to earn a superb draw. Sensational from this new-look team, with a fresh captain who will have won many, many sceptics over with this effort. A 194-ball effort to see his team through to the end. It was set up brilliantly by another man who had some proving to do - Usman Khawaja with his maiden century in Asia, the longest fourth-innings knock ever in the UAE. 75 minutes ago, Australia has five wickets in hand before they ran into Yasir Shah, who lives for the final 75 minutes. He nearly produced one of his magic spells again, but Australia have held on. Nathan Lyon and Travis Head playing extraordinary supporting acts too. After going 280 behind, this will feel unbelievably good for the visitors. But what of Pakistan? They had their chances, they'd set up for a much bigger score in the first innings than they ended up with, and the bowling this morning was markedly sipid. This will hurt them. Probably more than when they collapse to losses against Sri Lanka last year. Bilal Asif took six in the first innings, got none in the second. Wahab bowled only 16 overs. Abbas was exceptional once again, but it wasn't to be. Yet again, the final session in the UAE has screamed out at those who asked what the hell was happening to Test cricket with a largely dormant pitch.<br><bR>","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":139.4,"text":"Yasir Shah to Paine, no run, <b>outside edge</b> falls short of second slip.
