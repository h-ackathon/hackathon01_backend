Disappointing from the opener, who was looking fluent today. Went after a length ball, the kind he's been leaving. He's not someone who usually gets a big stride in. And that is the case here. Keemo Paul has been sixth stump line with shape away and when you look to drive that line without feet, you won't have a lot of success. Edge carries straight to gully at shin height <span class="text-bold"> 40/2 </span></div></div></div><div class="flex-row" data-reactid="957"><div class="wrap batsmen" data-reactid="958"><div class="cell batsmen" data-reactid="959"><a name="&amp;lpos=cricket:game:scorecard:player" href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/373696.html" title="View the player profile of Mominul Haque" data-reactid="960">Mominul Haque</a></div><div class="cell commentary" data-reactid="961"><a class="icon-font-before collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#commentary-003-3" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="commentary-003">lbw b Chase</a></div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="962">15</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="963">43</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="964">3</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="965">0</div><div class="cell runs" data-reactid="966">34.88</div><div class="cell highlight active" data-reactid="967"></div></div><div id="commentary-003-3" class="commentary-content collapse" data-reactid="968"><div class="content" data-reactid="969"><span class="text-bold"> 14.5 </span> <b>he's been given lbw and has reviewed it.</b> A strange sequence this.
