England had their foot in the door in all the Tests but we've been able to win key moments. It's been a really exciting series and have played good cricket. It's been nice to have these Tests without any injuries, a lot of work went into it. Can be tough to take 20 wickets and the guys were outstanding. Can't thank them enough for that, proud of everyone. I just love being in the middle, doing a job for my team. I work very hard, my mind is in as good as space as it's ever been. I'm really proud of being able to lead from the front.\"\n\nWe'll have plenty of the ground over the next few hours but that's that for another Ashes series. Well played, Australia. Led superbly by Steven Smith. England have a lot to ponder in their Test game. They have two matches in New Zealand at the end of March then a home season against Pakistan and India. The squad for New Zealand will be named in two days. Australia's next Test challenge is the mouthwatering prospect of South Africa in their backyard. That should be a ripper. Before all that, though, there is a one-day series which begins on Sunday followed by T20s. We'll be back to bring you all the action from those matches but, for now, from Miller, Gnasher, Alan and everyone else who has been a part of the coverage, it's goodbye and thanks for joining us!","hasVideoId":false}],"overNo":89,"completed":false},{"comments":[{"timeStamp":87.6,"text":"Lyon to Curran, no run, floated up and blocked getting on to the front foot outside off","event":0,"commId":"387060","commSeq":308706,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"Well, England have somehow made it to <b>drinks</b>.
