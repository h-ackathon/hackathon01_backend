It's the dip from Ashwin that has done him in, beautiful bowling. Presses forward to one that is nicely tossed up, there's enough turn and bounce off the deck to lob off the pad, then a bit of glove? Doesn't look like on replay. Pant grabs the lob. Spring in India's steps as <b> they walk off for tea. </b> Could he have reviewed? Possibly, because replays don't conclusively prove there was a glove. May have been a very, very thin one if at all, but well worth going up if he wasn't entirely sure.

It was great fun bringing this to you. On behalf of Alex, it's time for me, Shashank Kishore, to say goodbye. Look forward to Perth. Don't forget to come back soon for all the post-match stuff from Sid Monga, Dan Brettig and Mel Farrell. Cheers guys.\n\n\n<b> Ravi Shastri </b> chats with Sony, the broadcasters in India.\n\n<b> On what this win means to the side: </b> \"We lost the first Test in England by 31, lost the first  Test in South Africa by 60-70, so this is a very good feeling for the boys to come out on top,\" says Ravi Shastri. \"When you get off to a good start, there's belief. There was some rash shots played in the first innings, that was foolish cricket, but they learnt from it. Pujara was absolutely magnificent, we've asked him to be a little more upright to counter bounce in these conditions.\"\n\n<b> On the plans leading into the second Test: </b> \"They have to rest up, to hell with the nets. You just come there, mark your attendance and get away to the hotel. We know the Perth track is quick, it's a drop in surface, there'll be something there for the fast bowlers. They need rest. I thought the bowlers were brilliant in the first innings, defending 250, the discipline was magnificent. They've worked on it, it's not come in overnight. As a bowling unit, when you show that discipline, it doesn't matter which side you play against. You will be successful.\"\n\n\n<b> On Rishabh Pant: </b> You have to allow him to play his game, that's the way he has come into the side, but he has to be a little more sensible now. He did the hard work in getting Lyon to spread his fields, so he has to be smarter. You make a mistake now, but don't repeat it, then I'll be in his ears.\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/team/smallest_margins.html?class=1;id=6;type=team\" target=\"_blank\">It is India's third closest Test win in terms of runs.</a>\n\nIndia win just their sixth Test match in Australia. Cheteshwar Pujara was simply phenomenal in a low scoring game and the four-man attack did the job. Rishabh Pant equalled the world record for the most catches in a Test match with 11. This Test had it all. What is in store for Perth? \n\nThanks for your company for the last five days. On behalf of Shashank Kishore and all the team we hope you enjoyed it. Join us for the second Test from the brand new Perth Stadium on Friday. Until then, bye for now.\n\n<strong>Presentation</strong> <b>Tim Paine</b>: \"It's pretty shattering. But India thoroughly deserved to win. We thought we could do it. But our batters couldn't bat for long enough with our tail to win. I thought Pujara was probably the difference between the two sides. We go to Perth with a belief we can still win this Test series\" How's the finger?: \"Finger is fine. Thank you\"\n\n<b>Virat Kohli</b>: \"It's important to stay calm. The odds were stacked up against them as soon as we got Pat Cummins out. I wouldn't say I was cool as ice but you try not to show it. It was just a matter of one mistake or one good ball. Super proud to have four bowlers and take 20 wickets to win this Test match. It's up to our batsmen to step up in this series. Pujara and Rahane stood up in this match. I thought we were the better team and deserved to win. I think when they bat together like that they are our most solid pair. I think it took a lot of grit and determination to put us past Australia. I think our middle order and lower order could've done better. These things are things to keep in mind for Perth. But if you had given me 1-0 up after the first game I would've taken that\"\n\n<b>Cheteshwar Pujara is Player of the Match</b>: \"I think playing here before has helped me a lot. I think what has helped me is the preparation. Ultimately winning the Test match credit to all the bowlers. The first innings lead of 15 gave us the belief batting in the second innings. I always back my ability and I've got enough experience.\" \"It means a lot, he'll be a proud father. I'd like to thank him for all his support throughout my career.\"\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">First time in India&#39;s history that they have won an away Test after losing first 4 wickets for less than 50 runs. <br><br>They started batting with 41-4 and ended with 4 wickets for 4 runs. Tells how important were Pujara&#39;s 123 and 71 between collapses. A genuine match-winning effort.</p>&mdash; Mazher Arshad (@MazherArshad) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MazherArshad/status/1071997559290372096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 10, 2018</a></blockquote>\n\n\nHazlewood bows his head. Lyon was on his haunches. Kohli celebrated and roared with delight. What a win by India. What a Test match. India lead the series 1-0. Both sides shake hands. Great respect between the teams. Lyon gets a great round of applause from the Australian fans as he heads into the rooms.\n\nRishabh Pant, who equalled the wicketkeepers catching record in this famous Test: \"It was really nervous as they were coming close, but we did well. I'm very happy to contribute to the team, first time getting to this milestone. I always enjoy troubling batsmen, I love it when they concentrate on me and not on the bowlers.\"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":119.4,"text":"Ashwin to Hazlewood, no run, good length, a bit of bounce, but he bunts it down again","event":0,"commId":"4119040","commSeq":411904,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":119.3,"text":"Ashwin to Hazlewood, no run, looped higher outside off, he stretches out and defends to silly mid off","event":0,"commId":"4119030","commSeq":411903,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":119.2,"text":"Ashwin to Hazlewood, no run, full, drifting into middle, he defends from the crease back to the bowler","event":0,"commId":"4119020","commSeq":411902,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":119.1,"text":"Ashwin to Hazlewood, no run, slid through quicker, defends from the crease, inside edge onto body and it drops down","event":0,"commId":"4119010","commSeq":411901,"dismissalText":"","pre":"Lyon gets some fresh gloves run out to him.
