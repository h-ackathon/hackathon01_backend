It's been an enthralling, surprising and most-satisfying series, so thanks for joining us. Go have a squiz at <a href=http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/18913/report/1158064/west-indies-vs-england-3rd-test-england-tour-of-wi-2018-19 target=_blank>Valkerie's report</a>, then stick around the site for more reaction and analysis from George Dobell and the rest of the team. From myself, Miller, Raghav, Ranjith and the rest, it's cheerio for now. We'll be back for the one-dayers, starting next week. Byeeeeeeeee! \n\n<b>4.55pm:</b> Time for the presentations at the Darren Sammy Stadium... Starting with England captain, <b>Joe Root</b>: \"I thought we played some good cricket. In that first innings we managed to find a way to ride out some difficult moments in bowler-friendly conditions and then we got up to a good score. Then the bowlers got us on top and we went from there. We played better, that's important, we've got a fantastic squad, but over the next couple of years you'll see a huge amount of improvement. [Hundred?] I spent some time working on things, make sure I'm lining things up, disappointed to get out in the manner I did in the first innings but nice to make it count. [Wood?] He bowled fantastically well, great pace, made for great theatre, great to be on the field watching it and to see him come back into the side and show how good a player he is. Important we performed well this week, tough tour, West Indies have played fantastically but for us to come back and win is pleasing and a real step forward. Thank you to everyone that's come and watched over the three games.\"\n\n<b>Mark Wood</b> is named Man of the Match: \"I was full of confidence after the Lions tour, wanted to hit the ground running and back it up. [Pace?] I don't know, wasn't thinking about the gun, watched Gabriel all series knocking us down, thought I had to get some back for us. [Second innings?] Like running on a beach running in, we gave it a good go and got over the line. [Ashes spot?] I'm not thinking that far ahead, we've got a great squad, plenty more cricket to go. Kevin Shine, Chris Silverwood, they've kept the faith in me, so I'm very thankful.\"\n\n<b>Kemar Roach</b> is named Man of the Series: \"Pretty good series for me, all the hard work has paid off. Very competitive, pleased for the first Test series win of 2019. Ball felt good in my had, put in the right areas and got the rewards. Coming up here, we put our best foot forward, but a great feeling to win a series, been a while. Very proud of the guys and want us to work hard and move forward. Good to get on the park, looking forward to the cricket coming up and doing well for the West Indies. [Bowling strength?] Batting could be better, but the guys stuck to the task, working hard in the nets, stay positive and stick to the process, trust yourself and we'll get it.\"\n\nAnd here's West Indies' (technically suspended) captain, <b>Jason Holder</b>: \"Bit disappointed [to lose], but still positives. Credit to the boys, we played a good series, lots of improvement but lots of positive coming out of the series. I tried to share as much info as I could, tough watching from the outside. The way we've won, it shows we're moving in the right direction. [Chase ton?] Really pleasing, had a chat with Roston before the game, good to see him get some runs. We could have rolled over, given it up, but I'm really happy he could get his hundred. [Next challenges?] Three facets of the game, we have to be clinical. Bowling has been outstanding, we need to strike a good balance. Counts in the rankings, counts for the morale of the side as well. We need to continue to build and not just rest on our laurels. Places we can improve, we want to be No.1. Thanks to those who came and supported us, and the the English who came out as well.\"\n\n<b>4.40pm: England win by 232 runs</b>, but West Indies take the series 2-1. No blackwash this time, but the home side certainly fronted up; they made it difficult for England here, too, despite being well behind the game. Roston Chase dredged up a gritty knock, having come in at 10 for 3, defying each and every member of the England attack through the course of the day. Still, England will take victory however it comes, after a chastening couple of weeks. This is only the second Test they've won in the Caribbean since 2004.\n\nHere's James De Lamber: \"Regardless of how well they played this test, the fact that a one-legged Keemo Paul has just smacked Stokes for 3 fours sums up England's tour: completely outplayed by a team that everyone thought hadn't got a hope in hell of a match win, let alone a series win!\" There we go, an illustrative tableau to finish off a memorable series\n\n\"Root will be MoM, but I feel it should go to Wood, who really blasted the match open,\" opines Dhananjay. Gets my vote\n\n\"MoM, MoS and Mof the Winter: Moeen Ali. 32 wickets@25,\" pipes up Tony Torrance. Yep, his bowling has really come on over the last two series. Batting still a bit flaky, mind, but that's the Mo we love\n<p>","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":69.4,"text":"Stokes to Paul, <b>FOUR</b> runs, low full toss and <b>he smokes this down the ground!</b> Like Gordon Greenidge, he's dangerous on one leg","event":4,"commId":"469040","commSeq":406904,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":69.3,"text":"Stokes to Paul, <b>FOUR</b> runs, pitched up and he latches on, sent rasping though point with a free swing of the bat, four more!","event":4,"commId":"469030","commSeq":406903,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":69.2,"text":"Stokes to Paul, no run, full toss, maybe an attempted slower ball, swung to the leg side","event":0,"commId":"469020","commSeq":406902,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":69.1,"text":"Stokes to Paul, <b>FOUR</b> runs, short ball, <b>Paul hammers it up over midwicket!</b> Nothing wrong with his arms, clearly","event":4,"commId":"469010","commSeq":406901,"dismissalText":"","pre":"Time for some one-legged tonking from Keemo...?","post":"","hasVideoId":false}],"overNo":70,"completed":false},{"comments":[{"timeStamp":68.6,"text":"Denly to Chase, no run, tossed up and tapped away","event":0,"commId":"468060","commSeq":406806,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"Here's Aj : \"Honestly didn't think he'd get the 100 but now he's there that begs the question what do they do?
